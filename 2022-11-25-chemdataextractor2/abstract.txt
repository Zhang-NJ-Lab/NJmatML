Hybrid perovskite-based absorbers are promising materials for the fabrication of next-generation thin film photovoltaics, owing to their cost effectiveness and low amount of materials usage. Three-dimensional (3D) perovskite analogues have shown outstanding potential in terms of power conversion efficiency; however, the concern about its long-term stability impede its industrial endeavour. One such approach is the development and employment of lower dimensional, i.e. layered perovskite, structures that aim to achieve an improved stability along with competitive photovoltaic performance. Layered perovskite absorbers also provide a credible pathway of tuning the optoelectronic properties by judicious spacer groups. We highlight the use of layered perovskite-based absorbers and how its microstructure, optoelectronics, charge carrier dynamics influence the photovoltaic properties.

2 :New Oxygen-Deficient Perovskite La(Al_0.5Zn_0.5)O_2.75: Synthesis, Structure, and Transport Properties


Abstract The solid-phase synthesis of oxygen-deficient perovskite La(Al_0.5Zn_0.5)O_2.75 is performed for the first time. The perovskite crystallizes in space group Pm 3 m with a lattice parameter of 3.7932 Å. The cationic composition of the phase is confirmed via chemical analysis. It is shown that lanthanum alumina zincate has a mixed type of conductivity in the region of high oxygen partial pressures and temperatures above 500°C, while oxygen-ion transport predominates at temperatures below 400°C. Introducing zinc into the B-sublattice of perovskite allows high-density ceramics (>95%) to be obtained.

3 :Catalytic combustion of methane over La_2BCoO_6 perovskites containing Ni, Cu and Fe: impact of B-sites on oxygen species and catalytic activity

The effect of B-site partial substitution on the structure and the catalytic performance of cobalt-based double perovskites (La_2BCoO_6 where B = Cu, Ni and Fe) was investigated in the catalytic combustion of methane. The synthesized samples were characterized using XRD, XRF, N_2-physisorption, H_2-TPR, O_2-TPD, CH_4-TPR and XPS techniques. The XRD results showed the successful synthesis of cobalt-based double perovskites with single phase and rhombohedral structure. The incorporation of Ni, Cu and Fe created abundant oxygen vacancies on the double perovskites which improved oxygen mobility and reducibility and accordingly increased the catalytic activity. The catalytic activity of synthesized samples was in the order of La_2CuCoO_6 > La_2NiCoO_6 > La_2FeCoO_6 > LaCoO_3. The better activity of La_2CuCoO_6 was owing to the presence of the highest oxygen species, the highest reducibility and the highest oxygen mobility.

4 :Highly efficient catalytic hydrogen production of Co(OH)_2-modified rare-earth perovskite LaNiO_3 composite under visible light


The composite catalyst of crystalline Co(OH)_2 modified rare-earth perovskite-type LaNiO_3 was synthesized by physical precipitation-sol high temperature calcination method. The ratio between La/Ni and between Co(OH)_2/LaNiO_3 added presence obvious impact on hydrogen production performance. Under the illumination of the cut-off filter (≥ 420 nm), when the molar ratio between La/Ni is 2:1, the hydrogen production amount at 5 h reached 70.89 μmol. The hydrogen production of Co(OH)_2/LaNiO_3 under the optimal catalytic conditions was 4.5 times higher than of pure LaNiO_3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed good crystallinity of the sample and successful synthesis of the material. TEM and SEM were used to detect the appearance of the catalytic material. The Photoluminescence spectrum (PL), ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) and electrochemical workstations were used to characterize the catalytic performance, which is consistent with the hydrogen production results. It is indicated that the bulk Co(OH)_2 acts as an electron collector in the catalytic process, which significantly increases the transfer rate of photoelectrons, enhance the hydrogen production performance.

5 :Phase degradation of all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI_2Br films induced by a p-type CuI granular capping layer



It is necessary to evaluate the interactions between the different functional layers in optoelectronic devices to optimize device performance. Recently, the I-rich all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI_2Br has attracted tremendous attention for use in solar cell applications because of its suitable band gap and favorable photo and thermal stabilities. It has been reported that the undesirable phase degradation of the photoactive a phase CsPbI_2Br to the non-perovskite δ phase could be triggered by high humidity. To obtain stable devices, it is thus important to protect CsPbI_2Br from moisture. In this paper, CuI, a non-hygroscopic p-type hole-transporting material, is found to induce the phase degradation of α-CsPbI_2Br to the δ-CsPbI_2Br. The rate and extent of phase degradation of CsPbI_2Br are closely associated with the heating temperature and coverage of a CuI granular capping layer. This discovery is different from the widely reported water-induced phase degradation of CsPbI_2Br. Our work highlights the importance of careful selection of hole-transporting materials during the processing of I-rich all-inorganic CsPbX_3 (X=Br, I) perovskites to realize high-performance optoelectronic devices. 
6 :Sealing perovskite membranes for long-term oxygen separation from air



Oxygen is industrially produced by cryogenic distillation but the process is energy-intensive. Perovskite membranes can provide an economical solution for oxygen production because of low energy input. However, the technology is not commercialized due to one of the challenges which is sealing the membrane at high temperature. Unfortunately, there is no universal sealant that can be used for all perovskite membranes. Factors such as membrane material, geometry and operating conditions can critically affect the sealant selection. This paper overviews current sealing methods for perovskite membranes for long-term oxygen separation with various membrane geometries such as disk, tubular and hollow fiber.

7 :Effect of dyenamo orange as Additive for Fully Screen-Printable Perovskite Solar Cells


One of the efficient strategies for improving the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is to reduce the interfacial recombination loss, as well as to control the crystalline growth of perovskite by using additives. In fully screen-printable␣hole transport material-free PSCs with carbon electrode, the perovskite penetrates into the mesoporous structure of three layers (TiO_2, ZrO_2, and carbon), thus it is suggested that improving the perovskite crystalline growth will be very important to decrease the charge recombination and improve the transport of electric charge carriers. In this work, we introduced polyethylene glycol (PEG) as an additive into the perovskite precursor solution, which effectively improved the photovoltaic performance of the device. We found that PEG addition could effectively increase the perovskite crystal size and thus decrease the interfacial recombination loss and improve the light absorption by the perovskite film. When PEG was added, the performance of the solar cell increased from 11.07% to 14.71%, while the long-term stability of the device also improved.

8 :Grain boundary passivation with triazine-graphdiyne to improve perovskite solar cell performance


9 :Boosting optoelectronic performance of MAPbI_3 perovskite solar cells via ethylammonium chloride additive engineering



The quality of the perovskite light absorption layer plays a dynamic role in the photovoltaic properties of solar cells. The existing methods to prepare methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI_3) films render substantial structural defect density, particularly at the grain boundaries and film surface, constituting a challenge that hinders the further optoelectronic enhancement of perovskite solar cells. Herein, a unique approach was introduced: using a simple ethylammonium chloride (EACl) additive in perovskite precursor mixture to produce high-quality MAPbI_3 thin films. The results indicated that EACl could encourage perovskite crystal growth without experiencing the intermediate phase formation and would evaporate from the perovskite after annealing. Additionally, a gradient perovskite structure was achieved using this technique, which impressively enhanced the performance of the perovskite films. A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.03% was achieved under the optimal amount of EACl, and the resultant efficient device could retain over 89% of the original PCE after aging for 1000 h at room temperature. This novel technique leads to a facile fabrication of high-quality and less-defect perovskite thin films for competent and stable devices. 
10 :Investigation of La_0.75Sr_0.25Cr_0.5Mn_0.5O_3-δ–Ag composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells obtained via a low-temperature sintering process


La_0.75Sr_0.25Cr_0.5Mn_0.5O_3- δ (LSCM) anodes incorporated with Ag paste (AP) sintered at a relatively low temperature of 900 °C were evaluated. The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy displayed that the optimal electrochemical performance was acquired by incorporating 40 wt% Ag paste into the LSCM matrix. The electrical conductivity of LSCM–40AP at 800 °C in air and H_2 was 192 S cm^−1 and 9.96 S cm^−1, respectively. The maximum power density of the cell with LSCM–40AP at 800 °C exhibited a considerable increase by a factor of 1.6, when compared with the cell with pure LSCM. The durability of the single cell with the LSCM–40AP anode was analyzed. The result revealed that the cell voltage slightly reduced from 0.67 to 0.64 V at a constant current density of 0.25 A cm^−2 after a 100 h test, indicating good long-term stability of the anode sintered at 900 °C.

11 :Effect of Cs^+ Fraction on Photovoltaic Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells Based on Cs_xMA_1−xPbI_3 Absorption Layers



In this paper, we report the effect of the Cs^+ fraction x on the structure, morphology and optical properties of mixed organic–inorganic cation Cs_ x MA_1− x PbI_3 absorption layers prepared using an anti-solvent-assisted one-step solution deposition method in an ambient environment. By changing the ratios of cesium iodide (CsI) to methyl iodide (MAI) in the precursor solution, the Cs^+ fraction x varies from 0 to 1. The hole-transporting-material (HTM)-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on the Cs_ x MA_1− x PbI_3 absorption layers were fabricated in ambient air, and their photovoltaic performance was studied. Results indicate that when the Cs^+ fraction x is less than 0.3, Cs^+ ions mainly replace a fraction of MA^+ ions in the MAPbI_3 lattice and do not lead to a change in the crystal structure of the MAPbI_3. When the Cs^+ fraction x is between 0.3 and 0.7, one part of Cs^+ ions incorporated in the MAPbI_3 lattice replaces MA^+ ions (α-phase), while the other part forms a yellow photovoltaic-inactive δ-CsPbI_3 phase. The Cs_ x MA_1− x PbI_3 films with x  ≥ 0.8 contain much of the photovoltaic-inactive δ-CsPbI_3 phase. The band gap of the Cs_ x MA_1− x PbI_3 films increases from 1.53 eV to 1.65 eV with the increase of the Cs^+ fraction x . The PSCs based on the Cs_0.1MA_0.9PbI_3 films exhibit remarkable improvement in device efficiency and stability.

12 :Effect of FA^+ Fraction and Dipping Time on Performance of FA_xMA_1−xPbI_3 Films and Perovskite Solar Cells

The effects of the formamidinium (FA)^+ alloy fraction x and the dipping time on the properties of FA_ x MA_1− x PbI_3 thin films (where MA = methylammonium ) as well as the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been studied. Mixed-organic-cation FA_ x MA_1− x PbI_3 thin films were prepared using a two-step solution deposition method in ambient air. PSCs with fluorine-doped tin oxide glass/compact TiO_2/mesoporous TiO_2/FA_ x MA_1− x PbI_3/carbon electrode structure were fabricated, aiming to reduce the fabrication costs and improve the stability of PSCs. The results indicated that, when the FA^+ alloy fraction x was increased from 0 to 1, the x-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks shifted continuously to lower angle, while the absorption edge and photoluminescence (PL) peak shifted continuously towards longer wavelength. The Raman spectra of the FA_ x MA_1− x PbI_3 thin films, consisting of five typical peaks at 68.5 cm^−1, 77.5 cm^−1, 84.6 cm^−1, 139.1 cm^−1, and 283.2 cm^−1, barely shifted with incorporation of FA^+. In addition, the dipping time was shortened by using mixed solvents to prepare the PbI_2 thin films. The PSCs based on FA_0.4MA_0.6PbI_3 prepared with a dipping time of 15 min exhibited the highest average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.64%, with 74.4% of the initial efficiency being retained after exposure to ambient air at room temperature with approximately 50% humidity for 700 h.

13 :Mn-doped perovskite-type oxide LaFeO_3 as highly active and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen electrode reactions



Perovskite oxides based on the alkaline earth metal lanthanum for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes are promising catalysts, but their catalytic activity and stability remain unsatisfactory. Here, we synthesized a series of LaFe_1− x Mn_ x O_3 ( x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 and 1) perovskite oxides by doping Mn into LaFeO_3 (LF). The results show that the doping amount of Mn has a significant effect on the catalytic performance. When x = 0.5, the catalyst LaFe_0.5Mn_0.5O_3 (LFM) exhibits the best performance. The limiting current density in 0.1 mol·L^−1 KOH solution is 7 mA·cm^−2, much larger than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (5.5 mA·cm^−2). Meanwhile, the performance of the doped catalyst is also superior to that of commercial Pt/C in terms of the long-term durability. The excellent catalytic performance of LFM may be ascribed to its abundant O^2−/O^− species and low charge transfer resistance after doping the Mn element.

14 :Engineered surface properties of MAPI using different antisolvents for hole transport layer-free perovskite solar cell (HTL-free PSC)



Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attained considerable success within just a few recent years. This accomplishment is critically based on compositional modifications and morphology engineering of perovskite material or dependent upon prepared mesoporous-titanium dioxide (mp-TiO_2). However, no analysis of the antisolvent role used for crystallization of perovskite has been undertaken. Herein, we investigated the role of the antisolvent in the performance of hole transport layer (HTL)-free PSC (HTL-free PSC) based on the following sandwich structure: glass/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/compact-TiO_2 (c-TiO_2)/mp-TiO_2/Perovskite (MAPI)/gold (Au). We studied perovskite layers with various porosities and layer thicknesses, and revealed that the generated pinholes had a major effect on the HTL-free PSC performance. A possible reason for this is that the pinhole in the MAPI layer does not allow the MAPI crystals to generate charge pathways to the TiO_2 layer. The MAPI layer prepared by chlorobenzene demonstrated a compact and pinhole-free highly crystalline MAPI layer with enhanced optical and electrical characteristics. However, the MAPI layers prepared by toluene and diethyl ether suffered from severe recombination issues at the MAPI/TiO_2 interconnect. The dark current/voltage ( J – V ) curve of the HTL-free PSC prepared using chlorobenzene shifted to higher voltage, suggesting a reduction of the backflow of charges at the interface. The J – V characteristics under illumination proved that the HTL-free PSC fabricated by chlorobenzene using as antisolvent in this study, had the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.65% along with open circuit voltage ( V _oc), short circuit current ( J _sc), and fill factor (FF) values of 0.8335 V, 11.964 mA/cm^2, and 0.56, respectively. The enhancement in the performance of PSCs originates from improved perovskite film formation, more efficient electron charge extraction and reduced recombination process. The impact of antisolvent on properties of HTL-free PSC has been investigated. The HTL-free PSC fabricated by toluene suffered from severe carrier recombination. The HTL-free PSC fabricated by chlorobenzene has been showed a dense and pinhole-free perovskite that exhibits reduced carrier recombination and enhanced PCE.

15 :Modeling Film Conductivity for Ion Migration Analysis in Perovskite Solar Cells



Ion migration under stress is a major degradation challenge for commercialization of perovskite solar cells. This paper presents three different approaches to model the conductivity variation in perovskite films at elevated temperature, prolonged irradiation levels and strain induced in the lattice. The conductivity variation under any of these stressing conditions can represent ion migration across the perovskite layer because the conductivity is related to mobility and carrier densities. Ion migration can elevate the density of electrons/holes across the film if the stress condition reduce/lift the activation energy at the interface of the film and smoothens the ion passivation to the perovskite layer. In addition, the conductivity of the film is related to device metrics (e.g. fill factor) and also to materials properties (e.g. mobility and bandgap) and, therefore, it can be a significant measure of stress impact on device stability. For example, the conductivity falls under stress which represents the ion migration enhancement. In our modeling, we have shown that the conductivity is inversely related to temperature and strain ( σ  ∝ 1/ kT , σ  ∝ 1/ ε ) but is directly related to irradiation level ( σ  ∝  ξ ^1/2). We have fitted our modeling to experimental data reported in the literature and extracted the activation energy of ion migration mechanism under every stress condition. The band diagrams of the mechanism are presented and it is shown that stress can foster the ion migration by reducing the activation energy at the interfaces of the perovskite layer. However, the impact of heating is worse on film conductivity, whereas irradiation and strain have a moderate or slight effect on it, respectively. Our findings may provide a practical solution to obtain a measure of ion migration in perovskite solar cells for aging analysis of the cell stability and recovery rates under different stressing conditions.

16 :Enhanced electrochemical performance of the YBa_0.5Sr_0.5Co_1.4Cu_0.6O_5+δ cathode material by Sm_0.2Ce_0.8O_1.9 incorporation for solid oxide fuel cells application



The performance of YBa_0.5Sr_0.5Co_1.4Cu_0.6O_5+ δ (YBSCCO)–Sm_0.2Ce_0.8O_1.9 (SDC) composite cathode for SOFC is investigated in this paper. YBSCCO and SDC oxides are synthesized by the sol–gel method. The XRD result reveals that no obvious chemical reaction occurs after sintering the mixture of the YBSCCO and SDC at 850 °C for 20 h. The thermal expansion behavior shows that the YBSCCO– x SDC composite cathode has the suitable TEC values (13.3–11.2 × 10^−6 K^−1) for the common electrolyte. In different proportions of the composite cathode, YBSCCO–30SDC shows the lowest polarization resistance values, which are only about 0.022 Ω cm^2 at 850 °C and 0.034 Ω cm^2 at 800 °C. The electrolyte-supported single cell using YBSCCO–30SDC cathode is fabricated, and the peak power densities values are 567 and 432 mW cm^−2 at 850 and 800 °C, respectively. Layered-perovskite YBSCCO cathode is prepared by a sol–gel method. The YBa_0.5Sr_0.5Co_1.4Cu_0.6O_5+ δ (YBSCCO)–Sm_0.2Ce_0.8O_1.9(SDC) composites are evaluated as cathodes for SOFC. The TEC values of YBSCCO–SDC composite cathodes are decreased with SDC addition. The addition of SDC to YBSCCO cathode reduces the polarization resistance. High power density of 567 mW cm^−2 at 850 °C for YBSCCO–30SDC is obtained.

17 :Cesium-Trifluoroacetate Doped MA/FA-Based Perovskite Solar Cells with Inverted Planar Structure



Triple cation perovskites are of particular interest among halide perovskites due to their impressive photovoltaic performance. In this paper, we introduce cesium trifluoroacetate (CsTFA) into methylammonium/formamidinium (MA/FA) perovskite to prepare a triple cation Cs/MA/FA perovskite solar cell with inverted planar structure. The effects of CsTFA concentration and spinning speed of the perovskite layer on the morphology of perovskite film and performance of the perovskite solar cell are studied. We find that the power conversion efficiency can be 10.55% when the spinning speed is 6000 rpm and CsTFA content is 5%. When, ethylammonium chlorine (MACl) is then employed to passivate the Cs/MA/FA-based perovskite thin film surface, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is further improved to 12.19%. The results indicate that CsTFA can be a potential source of Cs ions for triple cation Cs/MA/FA perovskite solar cells.

18 :Stability of 2D and 3D Perovskites Due to Inhibition of Light-Induced Decomposition



This review investigates the stability of 2D and 3D perovskite materials for energy conversion from solar radiation. The lower tolerance factor with absorption wavelength at 8260 Å made the $${\rm{MAPbI}}_{3}$$ MAPbI 3 the most popular in perovskite solar cell applications. However, these materials are affected by a range of stability issues. The combined effect of light, moisture and oxygen can lead to the chemical degradation of $${\rm{MAPbX}}_{3}$$ MAPbX 3 perovskites. Hence, ternary antimony/bismuth halide came into the picture in the search for stable and nontoxic material for solar energy applications, but this material is characterized by poor photovoltaic behavior, with a higher band gap, lower dielectric constant and higher effective mass. Another strategy by atomic transmutation thus suggested double perovskites as potential material, with better stability, but the band gap energy (3.3 eV) of these material is situated near the ultraviolet (UV) range. Therefore, recent reports suggest $$\rm{ABS}_{3}$$ ABS 3 chalcogenides as a potential replacement without such drawbacks. Another alternative is to use 2D $$A_{2}A_{n-1}^{'}B_{n}X_{3n+1}$$ A 2 A n - 1 ′ B n X 3 n + 1 Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite materials, which show better stability with higher efficiency than their 3D counterparts.

19 :Compact Titania Films by Spray Pyrolysis for Application as ETL in Perovskite Solar Cells



Hybrid perovskite-based solar cells are projected as a potentially viable photovoltaic (PV) technology for large-scale implementation. The electron transport layer (ETL) should be dense and pinhole-free to facilitate efficient electron collection and transport from the perovskite layer to the anode, which is very important for achieving high-performance solar cells. In this study, a compact TiO_2 layer was synthesized by a scalable spray pyrolysis technique. The effect of deposition temperature on the transparency, microstructure, and bandgap of c-TiO_2 film was studied. Pinhole-free nanocrystalline films having > 85% transparency with uniform coverage was obtained on spray pyrolysis at 400°C and annealing at 450°C. Usability of the deposited films as ETL in perovskite solar cells was tested by fabricating solar cells (FTO/c-TiO_2/FA_0.85MA_0.15Pb(I_0.85Br_0.15)_3/CuSCN/Au) using the deposited films and comparing their performance. Cell efficiency close to 11.75% with a fill factor of 69% was obtained in the cell fabricated using the films deposited at 400°C.

20 :Thermal decomposition and structural dynamics in perovskite (C_2H_5NH_3)_2CdCl_4 crystals

10.1007/s10973-019-09187-4

In this study, (C_2H_5NH_3)_2CdCl_4 single crystals were grown, and their thermal properties were studied by the thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Phase transition temperature above room temperature was observed at 470 K. In addition, the cation dynamics in this crystal were investigated by ^1H magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) and ^13C cross-polarization (CP)/MAS NMR experiments. The Bloembergen–Purcell–Pound curves for ^1H T _1ρ and ^13C T _1ρ in C_2H_5NH_3 cation exhibited minimum values, and these curves represent C_2H_5NH_3 and C_2H_5 rotational motions. The activation energy for ^1H in the C_2H_5NH_3 cation is E _a = 22.63 kJ mol^−1, whereas those for ^13C in CH_3 and CH_2 are E _a = 18.05 and 19.14 kJ mol^−1, respectively. Furthermore, the proton dynamics of C_2H_5NH_3 undergo faster rotation than carbons. This implies that the molecular motion for ^1H is enhanced at the C-end and N-end of an organic cation, whereas the molecular motion is not free at the main chain carbons of the organic cation.

21 :Synthesis and Characterization of a Perovskite Nanocomposite of CdTiO_3@S with Orthorhombic Structure: Investigation of Photoluminescence Properties and Its Photocatalytic Performance for the Degradation of Congo Red and Crystal Violet Under Sunlight

10.1007/s10904-020-01762-9

Abstract Perovskite phase of CdTiO_3 nanoparticles (CTO NP) was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method at 180 °C for 12 h and 24 h. It was then annealed at 1050 °C for 3 h. Perovskite CdTiO_3@S nanocomposites (CTO@S NCs) with a needle-like morphology were synthesized by mixing CTO and S powders at 600 °C for 2 h. The obtained samples were characterized by Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry analysis (TGA–DSC), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Zeta potential, N_2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, and UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The optical, photoluminescence, and photocatalytic properties were investigated further. The diffuse reflection adsorption spectrum indicated that absorption peaks of the CTO@S NCs with the various S contents (5–30%) shifted towards the visible region. Tauc’s plots presented the band gap energy values for direct transitions, whereby 2.98 eV and 2.51 eV were obtained for CTO and CTO@S NCs (30), respectively. Photoluminescence spectra excited at both 370 nm and 400 nm wavelengths revealed a decline in the intensity of the emission spectra and had a minor red-shift at λ_ex = 370 nm. The photocatalyst performance was investigated for degradation of Crystal violet (CV) and Congo red (CR) dyes under natural sunlight. The results showed that the degradation efficiency of CTO@S NCs was better than that of CTO NP in both dyes. Kinetics studies indicated CTO@S NCs fallowed Pseudo-first- order kinetics for CV degradation and pseudo-second-order kinetics for CR degradation. Graphic Abstract

10.1007/s11664-020-08385-3

Carbon-based fully printable perovskite solar cells (CFP-PSCs) are attracting interests of many researchers, because of their easy large-scale fabrication and their high stability. In order to improve the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs, it is necessary to optimize the crystallization processes of perovskite films. Hydrogen iodide (HI) additive enhances the solubility of PbI_2 or PbCl_2 and retards the growth of perovskite crystals, resulting in round-shaped crystals and high photovoltaic efficiency. In this paper, the effects of HI additive on the PCE and stability of the CFP-PSCs are tested. It is found that PCE enhancement was achieved by mixing much smaller concentration of HI additive into the precursor solution as compared to the concentrations in other reports. The mesoscopic scaffolds might suppress the evaporation of HI additive, thereby enhancing the effects of HI additive. Adding 50 mg% HI into perovskite precursor solution, the many characteristics such as the penetrability of the precursor into the mesoscopic scaffolds, the crystallization of perovskite and charge transfer were improved, whereas charge recombination was reduced. Accordingly, the PCE of the devices with 50 mg% HI additive are improved from 10.12% (the device without HI additive) to 11.27%, corresponding 10% higher efficiency. The morphologies of perovskite crystals could be different between the inside and the surface of the mesoscopic scaffold due to the difference of the evaporation rates of HI additive. This result suggests that the removal dynamics of additive changes the effects of additive on the perovskite crystallization.

23 :Water triggered interfacial synthesis of highly luminescent CsPbX_3:Mn^2+ quantum dots from nonluminescent quantum dots

10.1007/s12274-020-3026-z

Currently, lead halide perovskite quantum dots (PeQDs) have attracted great attention due to their spectacular photophysical properties. However, the toxicity of Pb^2+ heavy metal ions in CsPbX_3 PeQDs limits their practical applications. Herein, a facile post-treatment doping method is proposed, which enables the preparation of highly luminescent low-toxic CsPbX_3:Mn^2+ PeQDs from nonluminescent Cs_4PbX_6 PeQDs at water interface. The monodispersed CsPbX_3:Mn^2+ PeQDs exhibit excellent photophysical properties, including high photoluminescence quantum yield up to 87%. The reaction process and doping mechanism are deeply explored through in-situ monitoring. By simply adjusting the halide composition of the original Cs_4PbX_6 PeQDs or Mn doping concentration, a series of CsPbX_3:Mn^2+ PeQDs with adjustable emission could be obtained. Further, the CsPbX_3:Mn^2+ Q-LED was fabricated and exhibited excellent orange light with the color coordinates of (0.564, 0.399), correlated color temperature (CCT) of 1,918 K, and luminous efficiency (LE) of 24 lm/W, which illustrate the great promise in light emitting diode (LED) applications. This work not only provides a facile method for the preparation of highly luminescent low-toxic CsPbX_3:Mn^2+ PeQDs, but also provides insights into the mechanism of doping process.

24 :Comparison of Physical Isolation on Large Active Area Perovskite Solar Cells

10.1007/s40242-020-0060-z

To reduce the quadratic scaling of the series resistance( R _s) and sheet resistance( R _st) of the devices, physical isolation of the large area devices into small pieces has been proven to be a reliable and cost-efficient patterning technique. In this paper, we got an interesting result that the physical isolation did not show obvious effect on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells(PSCs) when fixing the active area. Three different isolation types, unetched ITO, etched ITO, and laser etching whole devices, have been induced to investigate the physical isolation roles. The results show that the electrons and holes could be collected efficiently in active area for all the isolation types. The proposed mechanism illustrates that the nonradiative recombination and recombination of electrons and hole in inactive area do not influence the performance of devices. This work may open a new way for the commercialization of PSCs by reducing the complex process and the etching costs.

25 :Structural Features and Optical Properties of CH_3NH_3Pb_(1−x)Sn_xCl_3 Thin-Film Perovskites for Photovoltaic Applications

10.1007/s11664-020-08529-5

In alkyl ammonium lead halide based perovskites, the replacement of toxic Pb^+2 with a suitable nontoxic divalent metal cation without losing the photovoltaic performance is one of the prime challenges to the researchers. The understanding of the effect of replacing Pb^+2 on the structural and optical properties of alkyl ammonium lead halide based perovskites, and thereafter correlating their photovoltaic performances, comprise a fundamental study which is important towards developing efficient and non-toxic solar cells. In the present work, we used a wet chemical process to substitute Pb^+2 with Sn^+2 in different proportions into CH_3NH_3Pb_ x Sn_(1− x )Cl_3. The value of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, which is a measure of structural stability of the perovskite lattice, was estimated theoretically. The theoretical calculations were correlated further with the experimentally obtained x-ray diffraction patterns of the original and substituted perovskites. The optical properties of CH_3NH_3Pb_(1− x )Sn_ x Cl_3 (0 ≤  x  ≤ 1) perovskite thin-films were investigated by the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectroscopy. The bandgap energy ( E _g) for CH_3NH_3Pb_(1− x )Sn_ x Cl_3(0 ≤  x  ≤ 1) were estimated from the optical absorption spectra. The Urbach energy ( E _U) which predicts defects, disorder and crystalline imperfections within semiconducting thin-films were estimated for the prepared perovskite thin films. The steepness parameter which apprises about strength of electron–phonon ( E _e–p) interaction within perovskites were also estimated from the optical absorbance spectra to understand the effect of replacing Pb^+2 with Sn^+2. In addition, the variations in the surface morphologies of the prepared perovskites were studied using scanning electron microscopy. The I–V characteristics of the different cells were analysed and, finally, we attempted to correlate their photovoltaic performances with the opto-structural properties.

26 :The Influence of Fe Substitution in GdFeO_3 on Redox and Catalytic Properties

10.1134/S0036024420130324

Abstract GdMn_1 – _ x Fe_ x O_3 ( x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1) perovskite oxides were prepared by a sol–gel method. The catalytic activity in dry reforming of methane was examined. XRD, BET, TPR, and TGA techniques have been used to characterize structural properties, reducibility and carbonization of the catalyst. The H_2-TPR data show that an increase in the Mn content in the series of GdMn_1 – _ x Fe_ x O_3 compounds ( x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1) leads to a decrease in the reduction temperature. The study of the catalytic properties in the reaction of dry reforming of methane (DRM) showed that the catalytic activity of the studied compounds depends on the Fe content and increases in the series: GdMnO_3 < GdMn_0.8Fe_0.2O_3 < GdMn_0.2Fe_0.8O_3 < GdFeO_3.

27 :Photocatalytic hydrogen production on chemically etched strontium titanate surfaces

10.1007/s11144-020-01872-y

This work aims to investigate the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over acid (citric acid and hydrochloric acid) etched strontium titanate (SrTiO_3), which is promoted by 1 wt% platinum (Pt) as co-catalyst. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) analyses of the un-etched and etched SrTiO_3 are presented; the results indicate that etching affects the surface structure while it does not change the bulk properties of semiconductor. The results of the photocatalytic activity tests performed in a methanol solution using a semi-batch reaction system equipped with argon flow to collect hydrogen, 300 W xenon lamp as light source and gas chromatograph for the analysis, are also reported. The etching with 4 mol L^−1 citric acid increases the hydrogen evolution rate about 20% while the highest rate of hydrogen production over etched Pt-SrTiO_3 is about 550 µmol/gcat.h at the 6 h of the reaction test.

28 :Thermodynamics of BaCa_(1 _+ _y)/3Nb_(2 _− _y)/3O_3 _− _δ·xH_2O proton-conducting perovskites

10.1007/s10973-020-09852-z

Complex perovskites BaCa_(1 _+ _y)/3Nb_(2 _− _y)/3O_3 _− _δ ( y  = 0, 0.18 and 0.5) with 1:1-ordered structure ( $$ Fm\bar{3}m $$ F m 3 ¯ m space group) were synthesized by standard ceramic technique. The enthalpy increments for these oxides were measured in the temperature range of (295–1273) K by drop calorimetry, and experimental points were fitted with an integral of a single Einstein term. The hydration enthalpies for BaCa_(1.18)/3Nb_(1.82)/3O_2.91 (BCN18), directly measured by calorimetry, were found to be equal to (− 86.7 ± 4.2) kJ (mol H_2O)^−1 and (− 88.8 ± 4.0) kJ (mol H_2O)^−1 at (673.8 ± 0.8) K and (872.8 ± 1.1) K, respectively. The calorimetrically determined enthalpies of hydration were found to be in agreement with those calculated using water vapor pressure–temperature–composition data. The increase in the off-stoichiometry index y in BaCa_(1 _+ _y)/3Nb_(2 _− _y)/3O_3 _− _δ leads to more exothermic hydration heats. The enthalpies of formation from elements, determined by drop solution calorimetry for dehydrated BaCa_(1 _+ _y)/3Nb_(2 _− _y)/3O_3 _− _δ with y  = 0, 0.18 and 0.5, become less exothermic with increasing calcium content, and are equal to (− 1577.5 ± 14.5) kJ mol^−1, (− 1533.6 ± 14.8) kJ mol^−1 and (− 1492.2 ± 14.6) kJ mol^−1, respectively. The thermodynamic data obtained allow calculating the enthalpies of formation and enthalpy increments for BaCa_(1 _+ _y)/3Nb_(2 _− _y)/3O_3 _− _δ with arbitrary water content.

29 :Magnetic Characteristics of Nanocrystalline BiFeO_3-Based Materials Prepared by Solution Combustion Synthesis

10.1134/S0020168520120110

Abstract— Nanocrystalline BiFeO_3-based powder materials with an average crystallite size near 40 nm have been prepared by solution combustion synthesis from bismuth and iron nitrates using sucrose and tartaric acid as fuel. The materials have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, helium pycnometry, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis, and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Magnetometry results demonstrate that the magnetic response of the materials varies over several orders of magnitude, depending on the synthesis procedure.

30 :Red Light-Emitting Diodes with All-Inorganic CsPbI_3/TOPO Composite Nanowires Color Conversion Films

10.1186/s11671-020-03430-w

This work presents a method for obtaining a color-converted red light source through a combination of a blue GaN light-emitting diode and a red fluorescent color conversion film of a perovskite CsPbI_3/TOPO composite. High-quality CsPbI_3 quantum dots (QDs) were prepared using the hot-injection method. The colloidal QD solutions were mixed with different ratios of trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) to form nanowires. The color conversion films prepared by the mixed ultraviolet resin and colloidal solutions were coated on blue LEDs. The optical and electrical properties of the devices were measured and analyzed at an injection current of 50 mA; it was observed that the strongest red light intensity was 93.1 cd/m^2 and the external quantum efficiency was 5.7% at a wavelength of approximately 708 nm when CsPbI_3/TOPO was 1:0.35.

31 :Structural, Morphological and Dielectric Spectroscopy Analysis of Double Perovskite Bi_2MnNiO_6 Electronic Material

10.1134/S1027451020060464

Abstract — Exploring as well as examining novel functional double perovskite material represents an important aspect in the field of electronic devices. In this present study the electronic material Bi_2MnNiO_6 has been framed through high temperature solid state ceramic processing method. Its electronic structure, morphological and electrical characteristics has been evaluated. Its structure is found to be monoclinic through XRD analysis. The uniform and compact grain distribution has been observed form the micrographs. The impedance analysis of the ceramic suggests negative temperature coefficient of resistance behaviour. The important electrical properties associated with this compound may be essential in the development of next generation electronic devices.

32 :All-inorganic dual-phase halide perovskite nanorings

10.1007/s12274-020-2963-x

In the present work, we report the growth of all-inorganic perovskite nanorings with dual compositional phases of CsPbBr_3 and CsPb_2Br_5 via a facile hot injection process. The self-coiling of CsPbBr_3-CsPb_2Br_5 nanorings is driven by the axial stress generated on the outside surface of the as-synthesized nanobelts, which results from the lattice mismatch during the transformation of CsPbBr_3 to CsPb_2Br_5. The tailored growth of nanorings could be achieved by adjusting the key experimental parameters such as reaction temperature, reaction time and stirring speed during the cooling process. The photoluminescence intensity and quantum yield of nanorings are higher than those of CsPbBr_3 nanobelts, accompanied by a narrower full width at half maximum (FWHM), suggesting their high potential for constructing self-assembled optoelectronic nanodevices.

33 :Strategy for the Complete Conversion of Thermally Grown PbI_2 Layers in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells

10.1007/s13391-020-00250-z

Abstract We suggest a combination of morphological control and the introduction of an additive as a strategy to completely convert thermally grown a PbI_2 layer into the perovskite structure for inverted organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs). For 2-step PSCs based on thermal evaporation, the complete conversion of PbI_2 into the perovskite structure is a key parameter for device performance. To achieve complete conversion, we regulated the morphology of the PbI_2 layer by controlling the growth rate. Compared to rapidly grown PbI_2 layers, a PbI_2 layer grown at a slow rate contained pinholes that enhanced the diffusion of methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) from the PbI_2 surface. Despite the assistance of the pinholes, the conversion of the PbI_2 was incomplete due to the limited interaction between the MAI and PbI_2. Complete conversion of the pinhole-rich PbI_2 occurred by introducing an additive into the MAI solution. The conversion of PbI_2 was measured by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering using synchrotron X-rays. By controlling the incidence angle of the X-rays, we quantitatively compared the amount of PbI_2 as a function of the X-ray penetration depth. Using a completely converted 50 nm-thick PbI_2 layer, we obtained a power conversion efficiency of 9.44%. Graphic Absract

34 :Effects of Substitutions of Titanium(IV) Ions by Iron(III) and Niobium(V) Ions on Phase Formation in Lanthanide-Containing Systems Comprising Layered Bismuth Titanate Ferrite

10.1134/S0036023620110133

Abstract Phase formation in the series of Bi_3Nd_2Fe_1 + _ y Ti_3 – 2 y Nb_ y O_15 and Bi_3Tb_2Fe_1 + _ y Ti_3 – 2 y Nb_ y O_15 ( y = 0.0–0.6 and Δ y = 0.2) samples is studied. When Bi_3Nd_2Fe_1 + _ y Ti_3 – 2 y Nb_ y O_15 solid solutions (ss) are doped with niobium(V) ions, the formation of Bi_3Nd_2FeTi_3O_15 layered perovskite, a member of the Aurivillius phase family of general formula A_ m  _– 1Bi_2B_ m O_3 m  _+ 3 ( m = 4), is not dominant in samples where y ≥ 0.2. Bi_4Ti_3O_12 ( m  = 3) and NdFeO_3 phases are formed in the course of phase interaction under the chosen conditions. With higher niobium(V) amounts, a Bi_2Ti_2O_7-base pyrochlore ss phase is formed in the Bi_3Tb_2Fe_1 + _ y Ti_3 – 2 y Nb_ y O_15 multicomponent system. Dielectric spectroscopy shows that the phases in samples of both series where y > 0.0 undergo structural alterations associated with magnetic and electric ordering.

35 :Full-temperature covered switching material with triple optic-dielectric states in a lead-free hybrid perovskite

10.1007/s40843-020-1325-4

Optic-electric responsive materials have attracted much attention for their applications in temperature-sensing, actuators, and memory switches. However, it is a challenge to integrate various functions to form multifunctional responsive materials. As molecule-based hybrid materials usually consist of organic and inorganic components, the introduction of multiple functions can be achieved through structural construction. Thus far, even though full-temperature cover is required for device applications, full-temperature covered multi-switchable hybrid materials have rarely been successfully synthesized. Herein, the dynamic [(CH_3)_3NOH]^+ cation and luminous center Mn(II) were introduced to form a hybrid material [(CH_3)_3NOH][MnCl_3], showing multiple temperature-responsive behaviors. Upon temperature change, it exhibits multi-state dielectric switching response and intensity or peak shift response of luminous in full-temperature range (low, room, and high temperatures). These responsive behaviors are triggered by the motion or reorientation of [(CH_3)_3NOH]^+ cations and inorganic framework. Overall, the switchable photoelectric material has potential applications in multiple encrypted storage and sensor devices. 
36 :The Characteristics of Perovskite Solar Cells Fabricated Using DMF and DMSO/GBL Solvents

10.1007/s11664-020-08283-8

Organic solar cells are used in low-cost solar energy applications. Recently, organo-lead halide perovskite solar cells have attracted considerable interest. Low-temperature spin-coating is the simplest method to fabricate the low-cost solar cells; however, forming a continuous perovskite film by spin coating a precursor solution of lead iodide (PbI_2) and methylammonium iodide (CH_3NH_3I) is challenging. This work investigated the characteristics of perovskite thin film, prepared using dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/γ-butyrolactone (GBL) solvents in the direct mixing of PbI_2 and CH_3NH_3I. Perovskite films prepared using the DMSO/GBL solvent had greater crystallinity and compactness than those using the DMF solvent. Cell performance was improved by a perovskite absorber using the DMSO/GBL solvent to a power conversion efficiency of 8.87%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.82 V, a current density of 17.13 mA/cm^2, and a fill factor of 63.01%.

37 :Thermal Aging of Perovskite Based Natural Gas Vehicle Catalysts: Dependency of the Mode of Pd Incorporation

10.1007/s11244-020-01331-x

Catalytic performance of fresh and aged impregnated Pd/LaFeO_3 and sol gel LaFe_1−xPd_xO_3 Natural Gas Vehicle Three-Way Catalysts, in powder form and wash-coated on ceramic monolith, have been investigated. Aging at 980 °C in wet atmosphere has no detrimental effect on the structural properties with the preservation of the orthorhombic structure of the perovskite. On the other hand, a loss of specific surface area is accompanied with surface Pd enrichment on LaFe_1−xPd_xO_3 through ex solution process. It was found that the mode of Pd incorporation and subsequent aging has a limited impact on the catalytic performance at low temperature for the NO/H_2 reaction. On the other hand, sharp rate enhancement in NO and methane conversion occurs at high temperature related to change in the reaction pathway from methane combustion to reforming reactions producing more efficient reducing agents to reduce NO. Such behaviour has been explained by the coexistence of palladium stabilized at different oxidation state at the surface and inside the perovskite structure.

38 :Surface Modification of NiO Nanoparticles for Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Based on All-Inorganic Charge Transfer Layers

10.1007/s11664-020-08403-4

In the conventional n-i-p structure of perovskite solar cell (PSC), spiro-OMeTAD is used as the hole transport layer. However, some additives in spiro-OMeTAD, such as LiTFSI and TBP, can bring risks for perovskite degradation. Nickel oxide (NiO), a wide-band gap (3.6–4.0 eV) p -type semiconductor material with excellent electrical and optical properties, is widely applied in the PSCs and other fields. Given the suitable valence and conduction bands, NiO can effectively block electrons and transport holes, which are generated in the perovskite film after illumination. However, depositing a compact and thin NiO layer on the perovskite film is difficult because of the heat and solvent sensitivity of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite. Here, we propose a facile method to prepare well-dissolved NiO nanoparticles in chlorobenzene, and the NiO film on perovskite is further modified by oxygen plasma or hexanethiol treatment to enhance the hole conductivity. Finally, we obtain a n-i-p structured PSC on the basis of all-inorganic charge transport layer with an efficiency of 4.21% using the prepared NiO film, and the value is further improved to 6.10% after oxygen plasma post-treatment. Moreover, the working stability is enhanced remarkably as the spiro-OMeTAD is replaced by NiO film, which is important for the application of PSCs.

39 :Influence of cationic doping at different sites in NaNbO_3 on the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye

10.1007/s10971-020-05365-1

Doped NaNbO_3 has been successfully synthesized chemical route followed by heat treatment. Alkali (K) and transition (V) metals were used as dopants at A- and B-sites, respectively. Multiple oxidation states of V with K enhanced the photocatalytic performance of NaNbO_3. Degradation mechanism has been established for doped system under household CFL exposure. The present study presents the preparation of Nb-based perovskite with different cationic dopants (potassium and vanadium) for the catalytic photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) dye. For the preparation of powder samples, chemical route followed by heat treatment (at 800 °C) was adopted and X-ray diffraction confirmed the phase formation. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy supported the successful incorporation of dopants in NaNbO_3 lattice. Furthermore, the induced lattice distortion and resulted optical modification were determined by uniform strain model and UV–visible spectroscopy, respectively. As a result of inclusion of dopants, photodegradation of MB dye under household CFL exposure has been studied in detail by considering the different dye concentrations (1, 5, and 10 mg/L). Doping at both sites (A and B) in NaNbO_3 exhibited better photocatalytic efficiency (34%) in 5 h of illumination as compared to single cation-doped systems which can be associated to the higher content of lattice defects (as charge trap centers), reduced optical band gap and oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, intraparticle diffusion model suggested that low concentration of dye solution exhibited surface diffusion mechanism, while higher concentration followed boundary layer diffusion mechanism for the photodegradation of MB dye.

40 :Controllable optical emission wavelength in all-inorganic halide perovskite alloy microplates grown by two-step chemical vapor deposition

10.1007/s12274-020-2951-1

All-inorganic halide perovskites (IHP), CsPbX_3 (X = Cl, Br, I) exhibiting efficient optical emissions within the spectral range of 410 to 730 nm are potential candidates for many optoelectronic devices. Anion alloying of these IHPs is expected to achieve tunable emission wavelength covering the entire visible spectrum. Here, we developed a two-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for growing quaternary IHP CsPbX_3 (X = Cl/Br and Br/I) alloys. By exploiting the fast diffusion of halide anions in IHPs, the alloy composition can be precisely controlled by the growth time of the respective layers once the growth of the individual ternary IHP is optimized. Hence complexities in the multi-parameter optimization in the conventional CVD growth of quaternary alloys can be mitigated. Using this process, we synthesized single crystalline, homogeneous and thermally stable CsPbCl_3(_1− X )Br_3 x and CsPbBr_3(_1− X )I_3 x perovskites alloy microplates and demonstrated continuously tunable emission covering the spectrum from 428 to 715 nm by varying the halide compositions in the alloys. These alloy microplates also exhibit room temperature amplified spontaneous emissions (ASE) along with strong photonic discharges from the microplate’s edges and hence are potentially useful as a gain medium as well as optical cavities for emissions with wavelengths covering the visible spectrum.

41 :High-temperature PEMs based on polybenzimidazole and new nanoparticles for fuel cell application

10.1007/s10965-019-1923-1

The aim of the present work is employing BaCe_0.85Yb_0.15O_3-δ nanoparticles for improving textural properties and performances of proton exchange membranes based on polybenzimodazole (PBI) at high operation temperature. The novel proton conducting membrane nanocomposites are prepared by using various weight percent amounts of BaCe_0.85Yb_0.15O_3-δ nanomaterial by dispersing into polybenzimidazole using solution casting method. The nanocomposites membranes properties are studied using AC impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The prepared nanocomposites membranes reveal higher acid uptake, better protonic conductivity and thermal stability compared to pure PBI membranes. Highest acid uptake and protonic conductivity properties are obtained for phosphoric acid-doped PBI nanocomposites membranes while the inorganic compotent amount in the membrane composite is 5 wt.%. The prepared nanocomposites membranes are used in fuel cell sytems. Polarization property and power curves of the prepared membranes are studied at 180 °C. The results show that the obtained PBI/BaCe_0.85Yb_0.15O_3-δ nanocomposites has excelent potentials as proton exchanger membranes for high temperature fuel cell systems.

42 :Perovskite oxides as transparent semiconductors: a review

10.1186/s40580-020-00242-7

Traditional transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) have been widely used for various optoelectronic applications, but have the trade-off between conductivity and transmittance. Recently, perovskite oxides, with structural and chemical stability, have exhibited excellent physical properties as new TCOs. We focus on SrVO_3-based perovskites with a high carrier concentration and BaSnO_3-based perovskites with a high mobility for n-type TCOs. In addition, p-type perovskites are discussed, which can serve as potential future options to couple with n-type perovskites to design full perovskite based devices.

43 :Morphological and electrical properties of La_0.8Ca_0.1Pb_0.1FeO_3 perovskite nanopowder for NH_3 and CO gas detection

10.1007/s10832-020-00223-6

Nanocrystalline gas sensitive material based on Perovskite type La_0.8Ca_0.1Pb_0.1FeO_3 (LCPFO) sample has been prepared by the sol-gel method with the citric acid route. The gas sensitivities under different temperatures of the (LCPFO) compound have been investigated toward the two NH_3 and CO reducing gases. The synthesized compound has been analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was found that the compound exhibits an orthorhombic symmetry with the Pnma space group. The effect of the experiment environment (under vacuum and air) on the conductance and activation energy E _ a of the LCPFO compound has been evaluated. The E _ a values have been found to be in the range of 0.43  eV  <  E _ a  < 0.53  eV and to be located between 0.42 and 0.62 eV under vacuum and air, respectively. Furthermore, the lowest detectable concentrations (10 and 40  ppm ) of NH_3 and CO, respectively, have been achieved.

44 :Synthesis and electrocatalytic properties of LaFe_1-xZn_xO_3 perovskites

10.1007/s10971-020-05379-9

Perovskite-type oxides LaFe_1-x Zn_xO_3 were used for oxygen evolution reaction. The highest elctrode activity performance is acheived with LaFe_0.9Zn_0.1O_3 at 0.66 V. The best performing electrode exhibits a relatively excellent stability after 1000 continuous cycles. In this work, perovskite-type oxides of general formula LaFe_1- x Zn_ x O_3 (0 ≤  x  ≤ 0.3) prepared by a sol–gel route were investigated as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline KOH solutions. X-ray diffraction analysis of samples indicates that the pure cubic structure was obtained for composition lower than x  = 0.2. The OER studies indicate that substitution of iron by zinc increases the electrocatalytic activity of the resulting material significantly. The highest activity was achieved for x  = 0.1, whereas the obtained current density was 9.02 mA cm^−2 at 0.66 V, which is approximately three times higher than that of the base oxide. The Tafel slopes values for OER on each oxide in 1 M KOH are found to be ~89, 52, and 64 mV dec^−1 for LaFeO_3, LaFe_0.9Zn_0.1O_3, and LaFe_0.8Zn_0.2O_3, respectively. The stability of LaFe_0.9Zn_0.1O_3 electrode is studied in the process of 1000 successive cycles at a current density of 10 mA.cm^−2 of the OER. A small change in overpotential was found, ranged between 11 and 19 mV, indicating clearly its long electrochemical durability. These results suggest clearly that LaFe_0.9Zn_0.1O_3 electrode is a promising anode material for the OER in water electrolysis. Linear sweep voltammetry of LaFe_1- x Zn_ x O_3 electrodes in 1 M KOH, at a scan rate of 50 mV/s; inset shows the OER current density at 0.66 V vs. Hg/HgO.

45 :Phase Formation, Structure, and Dielectric Properties of Modified Potassium Sodium Niobate Ceramics

10.1134/S0020168520100076

Abstract — We have prepared (1 – x )(K_0.5Na_0.5)NbO_3– x Ca(Cu_1/3Nb_2/3)O_3 ( x = 0–0.1, ∆ х = 0.02) ceramics by solid-state reactions and studied their phase formation, structure, and dielectric and ferroelectric properties. The formation of a phase with the perovskite structure and an orthorhombic unit cell has been demonstrated in all of the samples. Ferroelectric phase transitions have been confirmed by dielectric spectroscopy and laser second harmonic generation measurements. The temperatures of the phase transitions from the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase to the tetragonal ferroelectric phase and to the cubic (paraelectric) phase have been shown to decrease with increasing x . We have analyzed the composition dependences of dielectric parameters in the system studied.

46 :Stable High-Efficiency Two-Dimensional Perovskite Solar Cells Via Bromine Incorporation

10.1186/s11671-020-03406-w

Two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic perovskites as one of the most important photovoltaic material used in solar cells have attracted remarkable attention. These 2D perovskites exhibit superior environmental stability and wide tunability of their optoelectronic properties. However, their photovoltaic performance is far behind those of traditional three-dimensional (3D) perovskites. In this work, we demonstrate the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 2D perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is greatly improved from 3.01% for initial to 12.19% by the incorporation of PbBr_2. The enhanced efficiency is attributed to superior surface quality, enhanced crystallinity, and the resulting reduced trap-state density. Furthermore, PbBr_2 incorporated devices without encapsulation show excellent humidity stability, illumination stability, and thermal stability. This work provides a universal and viable avenue toward efficient and stable 2D PVSCs.

47 :Mesoporous spheres of Dy_2NiMnO_6 synthesized via hydrothermal route for structural, morphological, and electrochemical investigation

10.1007/s11581-020-03644-z

Here, we report the synthesis of the double perovskite-mesoporous spheres of Dy_2NiMnO_6 via hydrothermal process exhibiting P2 _ 1 /n monoclinic symmetry. Field emission electron micrographs confirmed the formation of porous spheres. The elemental mapping exhibited the homogenous distribution of metal ions, i.e., Dy^3+, Ni^2+, and Mn^3+/Mn^4+ as observed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The Dy_2NiMnO_6 spheres exhibited a specific surface area of ~ 38 m^2/g, with an average pore diameter of ~ 10 nm. The specific capacitance for mesoporous spheres of Dy_2NiMnO_6 has been found to be ~ 395.2 F/g at the scan rate of 0.5 A/g. Furthermore, mesoporous spheres of Dy_2NiMnO_6 displayed stability over 2500 cycles with 71% specific capacitance retention at constant current destiny of 3 A/g. Graphical abstract

48 :Advancement in Inorganic Hole Transport Materials for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells

Organometallic halide-perovskite solar cells have undergone massive improvements in power conversion efficiency in the past decade, from around 4% in 2009 to 24% in 2019. A hotly debated issue in this field involves the investigation of economical, stable and power-efficient hole transport materials (HTMs) and electron transport materials in order to improve overall device performance and feasibility of mass production in the coming years. Even though the conventional ( n - i - p ) structure continues to be the most commonly used in perovskite solar cells, research in the field has shown that its potential for further commercial application is limited due to the higher J – V hysteresis and need for high temperature during fabrication. To address this issue, inverted ( p - i - n ) perovskite structures have been seriously examined because of their straightforward processability at low and moderate temperatures. These investigations have established that the HTMs are a significant part of the inverted ( p - i - n ) perovskite structure, which can render shape to a specific contact. They are perfect for reducing charge recombination and effective hole collection to enhance the overall performance of the device. This article examines in minute detail the different characteristics of inorganic hole transport materials used in inverted perovskite structures over the past decade, including power conversion efficiency, device configuration, energy band position and synthesis methods. It goes on to briefly discuss the stability analysis conducted to identify the factors which make perovskite unstable, so that possible ways to further optimize the performance parameters may be derived from the observations.

10.1007/s11664-020-08387-1

Due to the nontoxic and air-stable nature of bismuth-based photovoltaic materials, they are suitable materials to replace lead-based perovskite ones. In this research, the influence of doping with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) on the structural, morphological, and optical properties of silver bismuth iodide (SBI) compounds was investigated. Structural characterizations revealed the formation of the hexagonal structure in SBI thin films, and also showed improvement in the surface morphology in the MWCNT and RGO-doped thin films. All absorber layers had a relatively high absorption coefficient above 10^4 cm^−1 in the visible range, and the bandgap values varied between ∼ 1.83 eV and 2.04 eV. Also, we fabricated SBI-based solar cells, and their photovoltaic performance was studied. For the solar cell employing pure silver bismuth iodide, a photo conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.44% was achieved. The inclusion of MWCNTs and RGO dopants in the SBI thin film PCE increased the device performance, and the highest PCE of 1.61% and 1.32% was obtained, respectively. The stability of the solar cells was also investigated under the environmental conditions. Results show that after 30 days, devices preserved about 90% of their efficiency.

10.1007/s42247-020-00125-x

The different Pr_0.7Ca_0.3MnO_3 (PCMO) nanoparticles (NPs) with average particle size ranging from 46 to 80 nm were prepared through the sol-gel process at 600 °C, 800 °C, and 1000 °C. To check the effect of temperature on Pr_0.7Ca_0.3MnO_3 NPs, we have performed structural, transport, and optical properties. The particle size found increases with sintering temperature due to increasing crystallization. Raman spectrum analysis of all NPs does not show any phase shift with increasing temperature. FTIR spectroscopy studies show the presence of vibration of Mn–O around 600 cm^−1 indicated the formation of phase PrMnO_3. UV-Vis study of the samples illustrated a wide bandgap semiconducting nature of sample. Two types of conduction mechanisms are observed: thermally activated process in high-temperature region and variable range hopping (VRH) in low-temperature region, which further supports the delocalization of electrons between the multivalent sites of Mn, in the nanocrystalline system.

51 :Structure, morphology, and microwave dielectric properties of SmAlO_3 synthesized by stearic acid route

10.1007/s40145-020-0394-5

A rapid and facile approach was developed for the synthesis of ultrafine SmAlO_3 powders through the combustion of stearic acid precursors. The obtained products were characterized by typical techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to analyze the phase composition and microstructure. The dielectric characteristics of SmAlO_3 microwave ceramics, using the as-obtained products as original materials, were also studied. Compared with the conventional solid-state reaction method, the synthesis temperature was dramatically reduced to 750 °C. The large-size sheet structure was composed of a number of micro/nano-scale crystallites, which were mostly irregular in shape due to the mutual growth and overlapping shapes of adjacent grains. The SmAlO_3 ceramics with high density and uniform microstructure were obtained after sintering at 1500 °C for 4 h due to the favorable sintering activity of the as-synthesized powders. In addition, desired dielectric properties at microwave frequencies (dielectric constant ε _r = 20.22, quality factor Q · f = 74110 GHz, and a temperature coefficient of resonant frequency τ _ f = −74.6 ppm/°C) were achieved.

52 :Impedance Spectroscopy and Photovoltaic Effect of Oxygen Defect Engineering on KNbO_3 Ferroelectric Semiconductors

10.1007/s11664-020-08334-0

Perovskite-oxide (1 −  x )KNbO_3- x BaCo_1/2Nb_1/2O_3−δ (KN-BCN; x  = 0.00–0.20) ferroelectric semiconductor ceramics with oxygen defects are successfully prepared via a conventional solid-state sintering method. X-ray diffraction data indicate that the crystal symmetry evolves from orthogonal to tetragonal at increasing x values. Raman spectroscopic analysis confirms the long-range polarization of all compositions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the detailed chemical formula of 0.90KN-0.10BCN ceramics is 0.90KNbO_3-0.10BaCo_1/2Nb_1/2O_2.90. Room-temperature ferroelectricity weakens when the x value increases. The optical band gap narrows from 3.25 eV for x  = 0.00 to 1.57 eV for x  = 0.20, and the minimum value of ∼ 1.28 eV occurs in the 0.90KN-0.10BCN ceramic. Impedance analysis illustrates that the conduction mechanism of grains is mainly internal electron conduction, and that of the grain boundary is intrinsic conduction. The conducting mechanism of the ceramic system follows ohmic behavior by log I –log U curves. The maximum short-circuit photocurrent density and open-circuit photovoltage are 6.68 nA cm^−2 and 0.80 V, and stable output is maintained. The KN-BCN ceramic system can be used in photovoltaic materials.

53 :Enhancing the Electrochemical Properties of LaCoO_3 by Sr-Doping, rGO-Compounding with Rational Design for Energy Storage Device

10.1186/s11671-020-03411-z

Perovskite oxides, as a kind of functional materials, have been widely studied in recent years due to its unique physical, chemical, and electrical properties. Here, we successfully prepared perovskite-type LaCoO_3 (LCOs) nanomaterials via an improved sol-gel method followed by calcination, and investigated the influence of calcination temperature and time on the morphology, structure, and electrochemical properties of LaCoO_3 nanomaterials. Then, based on the optimal electrochemical performance of LCO-700-4 electrode sample, the newly synthesized nanocomposites of Sr-doping (LSCO-0.2) and rGO-compounding (rGO@LCO) through rational design exhibited a 1.45-fold and 2.03-fold enhancement in its specific capacitance (specific capacity). The rGO@LCO electrode with better electrochemical performances was further explored by assembling rGO@LCO//rGO asymmetric supercapacitor system (ASS) with aqueous electrolyte. The result showed that the ASS delivers a high energy density of 17.62 W h kg^−1 and an excellent cyclic stability with 94.48% of initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles, which are good electrochemical performances among aqueous electrolytes for green and new efficient energy storage devices.

54 :Preparing Ambient-Processed Perovskite Solar Cells with Better Electronic Properties via Preheating Assisted One-Step Deposition Method

10.1186/s11671-020-03407-9

Although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) increases rapidly, there are still some issues that limit their commercialization. The perovskite is sensitive to the water molecules, increasing the difficulty in the preparation of perovskite films in ambient condition. Most high-performance PSCs based on conventional method are required to be prepared in inert atmosphere condition, which increase the fabrication cost. To fabricate the high-quality perovskite in ambient condition, we preheated the substrates and selected the proper anti-solvent. As a result, the target perovskite films show a better crystallinity compared with perovskite film prepared via the conventional one-step deposition method in ambient condition. The PSCs prepared in ambient condition yield the improved PCE of 16.89% from a PCE of 11.59%. Compared with the reference devices, the performance stability of target PSCs is much better than that of reference PSCs.

55 :Monitoring of reaction kinetics and determination of trace water in hydrophobic organic solvents by a smartphone-based ratiometric fluorescence device

10.1007/s00604-020-04551-w

A smartphone-based ratiometric fluorescence device was designed to monitor the reaction kinetic process under vigorous mixing conditions, demonstrated by the hydrolysis of Cs_4PbBr_6 nanocrystals (NCs). In the presence of trace water, part of Cs_4PbBr_6 NCs (non-fluorescent) was converted to CsPbBr_3 NCs (strong fluorescent). Using anthracene as the reference fluorophore, the brightness ratio of the green (from CsPbBr_3 NCs) to blue (from anthracene) components in the fluorescence image which was recorded in situ by the smartphone camera was measured as the signal for kinetic analysis. It was shown that the water-triggered conversion reaction from Cs_4PbBr_6 NCs to CsPbBr_3 NCs follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model in the early rapid hydrolysis stage (up to 4 min). With increasing water content, the hydrolysis of Cs_4PbBr_6 NCs is promoted to yield more CsPbBr_3 NCs, which was used to determine trace water in n -hexane, dichloromethane, and toluene with detection limits of 0.031, 0.043, and 0.057 μL mL^−1, respectively. The device offers the advantages of portability and low cost for rapid field determination of trace water in hydrophobic organic solvents. Graphical abstract

56 :Structural, impedance and electrical evaluation of complex perovskite: Ca(Mn_1/3Ni_1/3W_1/3)O_3

10.1007/s12034-020-02229-w

A complex perovskite Ca(Mn_1/3Ni_1/3W_1/3)O_3, abbreviated as CMNWO, is synthesized by adopting the solid-state ceramic procedure. The X-ray diffraction analysis of CMNWO shows that the present perovskite is acquiring a cubic crystal structure having the cell dimension of a = 3.8321 Å. The obtained cell parameter is in good agreement with the theoretical cell parameter obtained from the SPuDS-V2.19.05.14 code. The micrograph describes the uniform grain distribution in the CMNWO sample. The average crystallite size of the sample was found to be 50.98 nm, which was calculated using the Scherrer relation. The dielectric and electrical properties like dielectric constant, dissipation factor, impedance, electrical modulus and conductivity of CMNWO were studied. The activation energies were determined from the AC-conductivity data in the temperature range of 200–350°C and 360–500°C. The dielectric spectra with temperature suggest that the present CMNWO is semiconducting in nature and follows the negative temperature coefficient of resistance kind of behaviour.

57 :Comparative Study on Methods for the Synthesis of CsPbBr_3 Perovskite Nanoparticles at Room Temperature

10.1134/S0018143920050070

Abstract Comparative studies of three different methods for the synthesis of colloidal CsPbBr_3 nanoparticles at room temperature have been carried out. Stability of these techniques with respect to the experimental conditions and ratio of the concentrations of mixed precursors have been determined, and the effect of the conditions on the average size of the nanoparticles, their sedimentation, and aggregative stability have been examined.

58 :Formation of Perovskite and Pyrochlore Phases during Mechanochemical Synthesis of Lead Ferroniobate

10.1134/S0020168520090083

Abstract We have studied the effect of mechanical activation in lead ferroniobate synthesis on the formation of perovskite and pyrochlore phases during both mechanochemical synthesis and subsequent firing. It has been shown that, during mechanical activation, the first to form is the perovskite structure. During subsequent sintering of the material, the pyrochlore structure begins to form as well. As the firing temperature is raised to 650–750°C, the perovskite structure is again formed. We provide explanation for this process.

59 :Structural, optical and electrical properties of multiferroic BiFe_1-xNi_xO_3 ceramic

10.1007/s41779-019-00408-5

BiFe_1− x Ni_ x O_3 ( x  = 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9) polycrystalline ceramics are synthesized by a solid-state reaction, and their structural, absorption, leakage current and electrical properties are investigated. The X-ray diffraction measurements show that the lattice parameter values increase with increasing the substitution of Ni^2+ ions for Fe^3+ ions. The optical absorption spectra indicate that the band gap energy increases with increasing Ni^2+ ions. Leakage currents are much decreased by about three orders of magnitude with increasing Ni ions. The J-E hysteresis was also investigated. Both real and imaginary dielectric constants are investigated as a function of both frequency and temperature. The room temperature dielectric measurement with a wide frequency range of 1 KHz–1 MHz reveals that the real and imaginary dielectric constants are decreased with increasing frequency of BiFe_1− x Ni_ x O_3 ( x  = 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) ceramics. The real and imaginary dielectric constants are found to be increased with temperature. The temperature dependence of ε ′ and ε ″ exhibits an anomaly which shifted to lower temperature with increasing Ni^2+. The anomaly indicates the possible existence of spin-glass states with Ni^2+ ion substitution in places of Fe^3+ ions.

60 :Study of Technology for Preparing Titanium Carbide and Calcium Metal from Perovskite Concentrate by a Carbothermal Method

10.1007/s11015-020-01013-9

Substantiation of using a carbothermal method for processing flotation perovskite concentrate is presented. Results of X-ray structural studies of compacted specimens after two sintering stages are provided. It is shown that titanium carbide is formed in the first stage, and in the second stage calcium carbide is formed followed by dissociation into calcium metal and graphite. A dependence is obtained for the degree of transformation of titanium carbide on isothermal exposure duration and excess carbon in the initial charge. Dependence of degree of calcium extraction on isothermal exposure duration is demonstrated. It is shown that the temperature for the beginning of calcium carbidization at a given pressure is ≈ 1600°C. It is established that briquette compaction pressure has almost no effect on calcium extraction, while it affects briquette mechanical strength. Thermodynamic calculations of equilibrium compositions of phases in contact involved in production processes are performed using HSC Chemistry application software. Results of differential-thermal and thermogravimetric analyses of a charge of a given composition of flotation perovskite and soot are analyzed. In order to study kinetic regularities, correlation coefficients of isothermal exposure duration and reaction rate constant are calculated using kinetic equations of Yander, Gistling–Brownstein, Zhuravlev–Lesokhin–Tempel’man, anti-Gistling, anti-Yander, and Tamman. Apparent activation energy for the first stage of the carbothermal process is calculated using a specific model taking account of results of experiments conducted at different temperatures ( Ea = 311.48 kJ/mol). It is established that the dependence obtained for the degree of transformation on isothermal exposure duration is most adequately described by an anti-Yander model formal kinetics equation. Optimum production conditions are selected for the process on the basis of research results: briquette pressing pressure is 8.57 MPa; first stage temperature 1500°C and 1750°C in the second stage; heating rate 17°C/min and 9°C/min respectively. In this case exposure time is 120 min and 60 min in the first and second stages, and residual pressure is 50 Pa and 13.3·10^–3 Pa respectively.

61 :High performance novel flexible perovskite solar cell based on a low-cost-processed ZnO:Co electron transport layer

10.1007/s12274-020-2896-4

In this work, high quality uniform and dense nanostructured cobalt-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Co) films were used as electron-transport layers in CH_3NH_3PbI_3-based planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) on a flexible conductive substrate. Highly photo catalytically active ZnO:Co films were prepared by a low cost hydrothermal process using the aqueous solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate, hexamethylenete-tramine and cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate. ZnO:Co films were deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) covered polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible substrates. The growth was controlled by maintaining the autoclave temperature at 150 °C for 4 h. The CH_3NH_3PbI_3 layer was deposited on the ZnO:Co films by spin coating. Spiro-OMeTAD was employed as a hole-transporting material. The structural, morphology and optical properties of the grown ZnO nanostructures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microcopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and photoelectrochemical propriety. XRD spectra showed that both ZnO and ZnO:Co nanorods had a hexagonal wurtzite structure with a strong preferred orientation along the (002) plane. The surface morphology of films was studied by FESEM and showed that both the pure and Co-doped ZnO films had hexagonal shaped nanorods. In the steady state, the ZnO electrode gave a photocurrent density of about 1.5 mA/cm^2. However, the Co-doped ZnO electrode showed a photocurrent density of about 6 mA/cm^2, which is 4-fold higher than that of the ZnO electrode. Based on the above synthesized Co-doped ZnO films, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs was studied. The Co-doped ZnO layers had a significant impact on the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs. The latter was attributed to an efficient charge separation and transport due to the better coverage of perovskite on the nanostructured Co-doped ZnO films. As a result, the measured PCE under standard solar conditions (A M 1.5G, 100 mW/cm^2) reached 7%. SCAPS-1D simulation was also performed to analyze the effect of the co-doped ZnO thin film on the corresponding solar cell performances.

62 :Lead-free all-inorganic halide perovskite quantum dots: review and outlook

10.1007/s43207-020-00058-5

Halide perovskite is attracting significant attention in optoelectronic because of its unique properties. Lead-free halide perovskites, in particular, have been studied intensively for their nontoxicity. In addition to the attention given to lead-free halide perovskites, the manufacture of these materials on a quantum scale has also received considerable attention due to the quantum confinement effect. This review discusses the current status of lead-free, all-inorganic halide perovskite quantum dots (LFAIHP QDs). First, synthetic methods for producing quantum dots are introduced; then materials are discussed with a focus on tin, bismuth, antimony, copper-based and double perovskite quantum dots. The properties of these materials-such as their physical structure, optical properties, electrical properties, and stability-are discussed. The application of these materials for solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, photocatalysts, and memory devices are also examined. Finally, the limitations of LFAIHP QDs, possible methods to overcome them and prospects for these materials in the future are provided.

63 :Synthesis of halide perovskite microwires via methylammonium cations reaction

10.1007/s11706-020-0515-7

Low-dimensional halide perovskites (HPs) have received considerable attention in recent years due to their novel physical properties such as compositional flexibility, high quantum yield, quantum size effects and superior charge transport. Here we show room temperature solution synthesis of 1D organic-inorganic lead bromide perovskite microwires (MWs). Our method uses acetone as a reactant, and when CH_3NH_3PbBr_3 is immersed, acetone reacts with CH_3NH_3^+ cations in the CH_3NH_3PbBr_3 single crystal by the dehydration condensation. The reaction generates a large (CH_3)_2C = NHCH_3^+ A-site which cannot be accommodated by the cuboctahedron formed by the corner-sharing [PbBr_6]^4− octahedral, leading to the transition of corner-sharing octahedra to face-sharing triangular prism and the crystal structure transformation from 3D to 1D. The formation process of (CH_3)_2C = NHCH_3PbBr_3 MWs does not involve any ligands, templates or catalysts. A two-terminal memory device was constructed using the (CH_3)_2C = NHCH_3PbBr_3 MWs, showing great potential of the method in fabrication of electronic and optoelectronic devices.

64 :Graphene influence on the structure, magnetic, and optical properties of rare-earth perovskite

10.1007/s11051-020-05001-7

Perovskite-graphene nanocomposites of rare-earth LaFeO_3-rGO and LaFeO_3 nanoparticles are synthesized and characterized. The preparation was done by citrate sol-gel method. The structural characterization has been performed using XRD and FT-IR. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) were used to analyze the morphology of the prepared nanocomposite. Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) was used to study the magnetic properties of the investigated samples. Introducing graphene to the structure results increase in M_S. Also, the optical and thermal properties have been measured and discussed, and the effect of graphene is observed where it decreases the band gap than reported for pure LaFeO_3 nanoparticles.

66 :Electrical, thermal and elastic properties of methylammonium lead bromide single crystal

10.1007/s12034-020-02164-w

We report temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity, thermal conductivity and mechanical resonances of as-grown hybrid perovskite single crystal CH_3NH_3PbBr_3. Structural phase transitions are analysed using new experimental techniques, where thermal conductivity by steady-state process and elastic modulai by ultra-resonance spectroscopy is carried out through [100] and [110] directions, respectively. Performing thermal conductivity measurement on small-sized samples usually pose a significant challenge due to its dimensional limit. Following the steady-state technique, we measured the thermal conductivity of around 1 W m^−1 K^−1 in the temperature range 100–300 K on 2 × 2 mm^2 size crystal. This is found to be comparable with I^+3 anion-based hybrid perovskites as reported by Pisoni et al 2014 J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 5 2488. Room temperature electrical resistivity and dielectric permittivity of order 10^9 and 10^2, respectively, shows sharp transitions while approaching 150 K, which strongly supports first-order structural transition. Thermally activated resistivity behaviour above 280 K follows 1/ T dependence, yielding activation energy of 0.2 eV. Softening of elastic moduli on approaching the phase transition is analysed from resonant ultrasound spectroscopy measurement. Square of the resonance frequency is found to diverge below 236 K, which inhibits any further experimental determination of elastic moduli at low temperature.

67 :Multiple magnetic phase transition and short-range ferromagnetic behavior influence on magnetocaloric effect of Sm_2NiMnO_6 nanoparticles

10.1007/s11051-020-04969-6

Structural characteristics and magnetocaloric effect of Sm_2NiMnO_6 double perovskite oxide nanoparticles synthesized via the solution combustion technique have been investigated. From the X-ray structural study, it is found that the Sm_2NiMnO_6 compound crystallizes in the monoclinic structure ( P 2_1/ n space group), where Ni and Mn atoms are ordered at 2c and 2d sites, respectively. Transmission electron microscopic image reveals agglomerated nanoparticles with an average particle size of 60 nm. Two magnetic Curie transition points ( T _C1 = 141 K, T _C2 = 67 K) observed from the isofield magnetization measurement affirmed the short-range ferromagnetic behavior of Sm_2NiMnO_6 creating the continuous second-order transition followed by the discontinuous first-order transition. A minor cusp at 10 K confirmed the microscopic superparamagnetic behavior at low fields apart from the dual magnetic phase transition. Adiabatic demagnetization of Sm_2NiMnO_6 nanoparticles was measured in terms of magnetic entropy, and the magnetic refrigerant capacity was calculated to be 0.44 J kg^−1 K^−1 and ~ 20 J kg^−1 respectively.

68 :4-Tert-butylpyridine-assisted low-cost and soluble copper phthalocyanine as dopant-free hole transport layer for efficient Pb- and Sn-based perovskite solar cells

10.1007/s11426-020-9725-3

The preparation of suitable hole transport material (HTM) is critical to the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with low-cost. Herein, a mass producible and soluble copper phthalocyanine decorated with butoxy donor groups (CuPc-OBu) was designed as HTM and prepared by a facile two-step synthetic route. To generate high quality HTM film, 4-tertbutylpyridine (tBP) was doped into CuPc-OBu to prepare the film and then removed by annealing. Such a tBP-assisted strategy resulted in the best efficiency of the PSCs with lead trihalide perovskite up to 19.0% (small-area of 0.1 cm^2) and 10.1% (the active area of 8.0 cm^2 for the module device). And the best efficiency of the tin-based PSCs with CuPc-OBu reached to 6.9%. More importantly, the device with CuPc-OBu as HTM revealed the remarkably enhanced stability. This work provides a new strategy to improve the film-quality of free-doping HTMs and enhance the efficiency and stability of Pb- and Sn-based PSCs with low-cost.

10.1007/s10971-020-05320-0

Inorganic n-type NiO and p-type ZnO has been used as hole transport layers (HTL) and electron transport layers (ETL), respectively, for the fabricated perovskite solar cells. The sols of NiO and ZnO have been synthesized using sol–gel method. The structural, morphological, and optical analysis of the synthesized ZnO and NiO nanoparticles prepared from sol has been done. The spin coating technique was used for the fabrication of HTL, ETL, and perovskite layers. The thickness of the fabricated solar cell is about 2 μm. The current density versus voltage (JV) characteristics of the fabricated solar cell was investigated. The JV characteristics revealed the value of various parameters such as short-circuit current density ( J _SC), open-circuit voltage ( V _OC), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency, and maximum power ( P _max) is 15.90 mA/cm^2, 0.93 V, 73%, 10.70%, and 10.70 W, respectively. The fabricated solar cell has been used to design a special electronic circuit with maximum power point tracker (MPPT) for monitoring of patient suffering from the heart diseases. The performance parameters of MPPT circuit have been tested under “direct sunlight” and “artificial shadow.” The energy consumption and 1-day performance load of the designed circuit is tested with the solar cell. The e-monitoring of patient suffering from heart diseases is done with the help of bluetooth low energy (BLE) to measure blood pressure (BP), heartbeat, photoplethysmography (PPG), electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. e-monitoring of human health through wireless body area network. MPPT circuit is design for minimizing energy consumption. e-monitoring of patient suffering from heart disease done.

70 :Synthesis and enhanced luminescence properties of double perovskite NaLa_0.95−xY_xEu_0.05MgWO_6 phosphors

10.1007/s12598-019-01233-2

Double perovskite Na(La, Y)MgWO_6:Eu^3+ phosphors were obtained by the sol–gel method. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) patterns, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and photoluminescence properties were carried out to study the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Enhanced optical properties were obtained by adding 3 wt% PEG under the excitation of 395 nm. Y^3+ with smaller radius was selected to substitute La^3+ in this host to decrease the symmetry and further enhance the luminescence properties. With Y^3+ concentration increasing, Na_2WO_4 and Y_30W_8O_69 phases came up. The emission spectra showed different shapes, and the emission intensity was enhanced by doping Y^3+. Under the excitation of 395 and 465 nm, the emission intensity reached the maximum. The Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of the phosphors were on the edge of the CIE diagram, illustrating that this double perovskite phosphor showed good color purity. Above luminescence properties showed that the synthesized phosphors had great potential in solid-state lighting.

71 :Continuous-flow synthesis of doped all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals enabled by a microfluidic reactor for light-emitting diode application

10.1007/s40843-020-1374-7

All-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (AIPNCs) possess the advantages of narrow emission spectrum, high quantum efficiency of luminescence and tunable luminescence position, which show abroad application prospect in the fields of optoelectronic materials and devices. Ion doping can tune their pristine crystal structures and luminescent properties or endow the AIPNCs with additional functionalities. Herein, a microfluidic reactor is designed to produce the Ce^3+-doped AIPNCs based on the continuous-flow reaction. The mechanism of the flow synthesis of Ce^3+-doped AIPNCs is the efficient physical mixing of the precursor ions in the confined micro-channel, the reaction nucleation of crystal seeds in the poor solvent and the crystal growth of the doped AIPNCs along the flow direction. The synthesis process can be on-line monitored by an optical fiber absorption spectrometer and an optical fiber fluorescence spectrometer. The doping concentration of Ce^3+ can be facilely controlled by changing the flow parameters in the microfluidic reactor, and the highest value reaches 1%. The Ce^3+ doping can improve the photoluminescence efficiency and the stability of the AIPNCs. The Ce^3+-doped CsPbBr_3 AIPNCs can be used to manufacture green light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a high color purity of 93.3% and white LEDs with correlated color temperature (CCT) of 10,436 K, CIE color coordinates of (0.261, 0.317) and color-rendering index (CRI) of 72.1. The continuous and controllable synthesis of AIPNCs by microfluidic reactor opens up new avenues for the application of the high-performance optoelectronic materials and devices. 
72 :Structure and electrochemical properties of titanate perovskite with in situ exsolution as a ceramic electrode material

10.1007/s10832-020-00222-7

In this work, the structure and electrochemical properties of titanate ceramics with in situ Ni exsolution are investigated to identify the structure-performance relationship of the exsolved perovskite for use as electrode materials in solid oxide cells. The phase formation, redox behaviour and exsolution properties of the material have been studied. The characteristics of the individual electrochemical processes are identified and correlated with the Ni doping and microstructural evolution. The results indicate that the electrode activity is strongly dependent on the density and particle size of the in situ grown Ni nanoparticles. The interfacial ion transfer and charge transfer processes can be promoted by increasing the electrode surface area or improving the adhesion between the electrode and electrolyte, while the surface electrode processes including the dissociative adsorption are more dependent on the porosity and electrode/electrolyte interfacial region of the exsolved titanate electrode.

74 :Deep insights into interface engineering by buffer layer for efficient perovskite solar cells: a first-principles study

10.1007/s40843-020-1322-2

Recent years have seen swift increase in the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Interface engineering is a promising route for further improving the performance of PSCs. Here we perform first-principles calculations to explore the effect of four candidate buffer materials (MACl, MAI, PbCl_2 and PbI_2) on the electronic structures of the interface between MAPbI_3 absorber and TiO_2. We find that MAX (X = Cl, I) as buffer layers will introduce a high electron barrier and enhance the electron-hole recombination. Additionally, MAX does not passivate the surface states well. The conduction band minimum of PbI_2 is much lower than that of MAPbI_3 absorber, which significantly limits the band bending of the absorber and open-circuit voltage of solar cells.

75 :In situ exsolution of Rh nanoparticles on a perovskite oxide surface: Efficient Rh catalysts for Dry reforming

10.1007/s11814-020-0592-4

The catalytic activity of the Rh-exsolved Sr_0.92Y_0.08Ti_2O_3− δ - perovskite catalyst (SYTRh5) was examined for dry reforming of methane. The exsolution of the Rh nanoparticles over the SYT perovskite oxide surface was carried out under various reducing environments where the extent of Rh exsolution was significantly determined by the reduction time (4, 12, 24 h) and temperature (800, 900, 1,000 °C). STYRh5 catalysts treated at a longer reduction time and a higher reduction temperature revealed formation of larger metallic Rh nanoparticles on the perovskite oxide with higher surface concentration. For dry reforming activity, the SYTRh5 catalysts reduced at 900 and 1,000 °C for 24 h showed significantly higher methane conversion compared to others. The high catalytic performance of the SYTRh5 (900 and 1,000 °C, 24 h) catalysts was attributed to the high coke-resistance of the larger Rh-exsolved nanoparticles and stronger anchoring sites resulted from the exsolution process. Post-analysis TEM images exhibited limited carbon deposition and particle agglomeration of Rh over the SYTRh5 (900 and 1,000 °C, 24 h) catalysts. Lastly, in-situ H_2S poisoning was conducted to examine the regeneration ability of SYTRh5. Although catalyst deactivation was observed, the catalytic activity of SYTRh5 (900 and 1,000 °C, 24 h) was completely recovered to the original level once the H_2S flow was interrupted, indicating facile desorption of sulfur species from the Rh-exsolved nanoparticles.

76 :Surface decorated La_0.43Ca_0.37Ni_0.06Ti_0.94O_3−d as an anode functional layer for solid oxide fuel cell applications

10.1007/s11814-020-0623-1

Surface decorated La_0.43Ca_0.37Ni_0.06Ti_0.94O_3− d (LCNT) perovskite oxide was investigated as an anode functional layer (AFL) for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The surface exsolved Ni nano particles on LCNT scaffold enlarged electrochemically active triple phase boundaries (TPBs) without any agglomeration and mechanical failure. The Ni particles with 60 nm in diameter were homogeneously exsolved from LCNT perovskite. The Ni-YSZ anode supported cell with LCNT anode functional layer (AFL) exhibited a maximum power density of 0.94 W/cm^2, similar to that of the conventional Ni-YSZ AFL cell at 900 °C. The activation polarization resistance of the LCNT AFL cell was effectively reduced compared to that of the Ni-YSZ AFL cell, though it had higher Ohmic resistance due to thicker YSZ electrolyte and lower electrical conductivity. Our study suggests the potential use of LCNT with exsolved nano particles as an active and durable AFL for high-temperature SOFCs.

77 :Enhanced Cr tolerance of perovskite oxide via Gd_0.1Ce_0.9O_2 surface modifications

10.1007/s11814-020-0562-x

Cr poisoning of the SUS interconnect and the solid oxide fuel cell electrode is one of the crucial hurdles to achieving system sustainability. Among various approaches to solving this issue, the suppression of cation segregation, especially Sr, and preventing the electrode surface from direct exposure to Cr-gas have been considered the most important factors. Herein, the effect of surface coating on mitigating Sr segregation as well as the use of strategies for protecting the electrode surface from exposure to Cr gas are discussed. Using Sm_0.5Sr_0.5CoO_3(SSC) as a model film electrode and Gd_0.1Ce_0.9O_2 (GDC) as the coating layer via a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method, the Cr tolerance of the perovskite oxide electrode was enhanced. Electrochemical measurement at 650 °C for 200 h showed ∼2.5 times higher stability of the GDC-coated SSC electrode than the bare SSC electrode. Using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), the chemical states of the GDC-coated SSC electrode were characterized, revealing significantly reduced Sr and Cr intensity on the surface of the coated electrode when compared to the bare SSC electrode.

78 :Computational approaches to the exsolution phenomenon in perovskite oxides with a view to design highly durable and active anodes for solid oxide fuel cells

10.1007/s11814-020-0569-3

Computational approaches have been used effectively in material design for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). As a way to improve the performance and stability of anode materials in SOFCs, the exsolution phenomenon has been extensively taken advantage of. In the exsolution process, highly active and stable nanoparticles (NPs) are formed uniformly over the surface of the host oxide due to the anchoring effects of exsolved NPs in the host’s structure. In this review, we particularly focus on how computational approaches such as density functional theory calculation, phase field modeling, and analytic methods can be used to understand the exsolution phenomenon; this knowledge can then be exploited to design enhanced anode materials for SOFCs. We first review the nature of exsolution and then look into catalytic applications of exsolved NPs. From this point, we investigate how to engineer exsolved nanoparticles to maximize their catalytic activity with a view that any enhanced performance will aid future applications.

80 :A facile chemical route to prepare Nd[(Zn_0.7Co_0.3)_0.5Ti_0.5]O_3 powders and microwave dielectric materials

10.1007/s10971-020-05306-y

High-purity Nd[(Zn_0.7Co_0.3)_0.5Ti_0.5]O_3 powders with perovskite structure, which were employed to prepare microwave dielectric ceramics, were produced by a facile chemical route from a solution containing neodymium oxide, zinc nitrate hexahydrate, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, tetrabutyl titanate, citric acid, and ethylene glycol based on a citrate precursor process. Furthermore, the sintering behavior, microstructure, and microwave dielectric properties of Nd[(Zn_0.7Co_0.3)_0.5Ti_0.5]O_3 ceramics were evaluated. XRD and FT-IR results showed that the polymeric precursor could directly transform into Nd[(Zn_0.7Co_0.3)_0.5Ti_0.5]O_3 powders without forming any intermediate phase. TEM results revealed that the as-obtained powders after calcination treatment at 800 °C were approximately spherical in shape and slightly agglomerated with an average particle size of 15 nm. Typical microwave dielectric properties of ε_r = 35.26, Q  ×  f  = 236,800 GHz ( f  = 9.52 GHz), and τ_ f  = –28.6 ppm/°C were achieved for the Nd[(Zn_0.7Co_0.3)_0.5Ti_0.5]O_3 ceramics with a relative density of 98.7% sintered at 1250 °C for 2 h. The nanostructured Nd[(Zn_0.7Co_0.3)_0.5Ti_0.5]O_3 powders synthesized by a facile chemical route based on the citrate precursor exhibit high sintering ability and slightly agglomerated, which are attributed to the reduction of sintering temperature and improvement of microwave dielectric properties of the bulk ceramics. Single phase Nd[(Zn_0.7Co_0.3)_0.5Ti_0.5]O_3 powders were produced by the citrate precursor process. Nanoparticles prepared by the citrate precursor method possess high sinterability. High-quality microwave ceramics can be prepared at low sintering temperature. Citrate precursor route is an energy-efficient and simple method to prepare oxide ceramics.

81 :Study of Morphological, Optical and Microwave Properties of Strontium-Doped Cobalt Ferrites

10.1007/s11664-020-08212-9

This work presents the effect of structural variation of strontium cobalt iron oxide on the electromagnetic properties for potential use of a perovskite structure in microwave applications. Various grades of strontium cobalt iron oxides were synthesized with varying concentration of Sr^2+ and Co^2+ using a sol–gel auto combustion route. X-ray diffraction confirmed the structural variation from cubic spinel (Fd-3m) to cubic primitive (Pm-3m) and finally to a perovskite structure. Electromagnetic properties were investigated using a vector network analyzer over a broad frequency range of 1–18 GHz. It was found that structural transition from spinel to perovskite resulted in a considerable increase in permittivity, together with significant decrease in permeability. Electromagnetic response and reflection loss indicates that the proposed composition is a suitable substrate material for miniaturized antenna applications.

82 :Perovskite-Type BaTiO_3 Nanocrystal Modifier in TiO_2/CH_3NH_3PbI_3 Interface to Enhance the Performance of Planar Perovskite Solar Cells

10.1007/s11664-020-08216-5

Interfacial modification plays a vital role in boosting the performance of planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, perovskite-type BaTiO_3 nanocrystals prepared by immersing dense blocking TiO_2 (bl-TiO_2) in Ba(NO_3)_2 solution were used as an interfacial modifier. The interface bonding was improved due to the fact that BaTiO_3 and CH_3NH_3PbI_3 (MAPbI_3) have the same structure. Incorporation of BaTiO_3 nanocrystals effectively boosted the electron extraction rate and suppressed the carrier recombination at the interface. The MAPbI_3 grains nucleated and grew rapidly, resulting in larger grain size after introduction of BaTiO_3 nanocrystals. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, time-resolved PL decay spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements verified that the BaTiO_3 nanocrystals indeed promoted the carrier separation rate while suppressing nonradiative carrier recombination. By optimizing the bl-TiO_2/MAPbI_3 interface, the power conversion efficiency of planar PSCs based on bl-TiO_2/BaTiO_3 was improved from 15.03% to 17.71% [ J _sc = 22.49 mA/cm^2, V _oc = 1.12 V, fill factor (FF) = 70%].

85 :Tuning the crystallization process of perovskite active layer using a functionalized graphene oxide for enhanced photovoltaic performance

10.1007/s10854-020-03771-3

The nonoptimized morphology of the active layer has been a major bottleneck for enhancing the performance of perovskite photovoltaic (PV) devices. To address this challenge, the influence of graphene oxide (GO) additive on the device performance was studied using a two-step sequential deposition technique. Depending on the chlorine-functionalized GO (Cl–GO) amount, we observe dramatic changes in the morphology (e.g., grains, grain boundaries, and crystallite size) of the perovskite layer. Resultantly, we find that the optimized amount of Cl–GO is 5.0 volume % in the perovskite precursor PbI_2 solution, which affords the solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.14% in PV devices with configuration of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/NiO_ x /CH_3NH_3PbI_3 + Cl–O/[6,6]-phenyl-C_61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC_61BM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag. Importantly, this PCE is about 18% enhancement compared to the PCE of 12.81% in the absence of Cl–GO. Hence, our work provides an insight for fabricating high-efficient perovskite solar cells based on the relationship between additive processing and morphology, affecting device performance.

86 :Synthesis, Structure, and Properties of La_1 – 2xSr_xBi_xMn_1 –_yNi_yO_3 + δ (x = 0.15, 0.25, y = 0.0–0.4)

10.1134/S0036023620080057

Abstract The possibility of the formation of a La_1 – 2 x Bi_ x Sr_ x Mn_1 – _ y Ni_ y O_3 + δ solid solution ( x = 0.15, 0.25, y  = 0.0–0.4) and the effect produced by the method of synthesis on its characteristics have been studied. Single-phase compounds with a rhombohedral structure have been obtained at y ≤ 0.2. A further increase in Ni^2+ content leads to the formation of some additional phases, namely, NiO, Bi_7.72Mn_0.28O_12.14, or Bi_1.72Sr_0.53O_3. The thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of La_0.7Bi_0.15Sr_0.15MnO_3.22 and La_0.7Bi_0.15Sr_0.15Mn_0.9Ni_0.1O_3.17 coincide with each other and equal 12 × 10^–6 K^–1. The electrical conductivities of the samples synthesized by the citrate–nitrate (cn) and coprecipitation (cp) methods are one order of magnitude higher than for solid-state (ss) synthesis due to smaller sizes of particles (1–5 µm). The presence of impurities promotes an abrupt decrease in the electrical conductivity at temperatures below 773 K. The change of p O_2 within a range of 10^—7–0.21 atm has no effect on the overall electrical conductivity of the samples.

87 :Spectroscopic and Simulation Analysis of Facile PEDOT:PSS Layer Deposition-Silicon for Perovskite Solar Cell

10.1007/s12633-019-00284-5

In this research work, we have characterized and simulated a well-known hole transport material (HTM) for perovskite solar cell (PSC) and conductive polymer poly (3, 4- ethylenedioxy-thiophene) - poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS). The PEDOT:PSS is a better contender in the field of photovoltaic with its excellent combination of characteristics like high hole conductivity, stability and transparency. The nanocomposite PEDOT:PSS is deposited on the silicon wafer which is N-type doped for the testing the structure characteristic variations. The thin film of PEDOT:PSS over Silicon wafer is prepared with the conventional coating technique and characterized with spectroscopic techniques. The structural behavior has been disclosed under the comprehensive study of Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) mapping. On the other hand, the important optical properties were revealed by detailed analysis by spectroscopy characterization (FTIR, UV-vis, Raman spectra) covering the range of 200–2500 nm. The maximum absorbance range of PEDOT:PSS is 270–320 nm with maximum absorption at 280.5 nm. The photovoltaic cell is simulated by using Spiro-OMeTAD and PEDOT:PSS as Hole Transport Layer (HTL) for a better comparison in terms of power efficiency, quantum efficiency and fill factor. The PSC device shows exemplary power efficiency of 11.89% and 12.13% for PEDOT:PSS & Spiro-OMeTAD as HTL respectively.

88 :Flexible optoelectronic devices based on metal halide perovskites

10.1007/s12274-020-2805-x

The unique physical and chemical properties of metal halide perovskites predestine the devices to achieve high performance in optoelectronic field. Among the numerous high qualities of perovskites, their different low-temperature synthesis methods and preparation processes make them impressive and popular materials for flexible optoelectronic devices. Mainstream perovskite devices, for instance, solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes, have been fabricated on flexible substrates and show outstanding flexibility as well as high performance. For soft wearable electronic systems, mechanical flexibility is the premier condition. Compared to common devices based on rigid substrates, flexible perovskite devices are more practical and see widespread applications in energy, detection, display, and other fields. This review summarizes the recent progress of flexible perovskite solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes. The design and fabrication of different high-performance flexible perovskite devices are introduced. Various low-dimensional perovskite materials and configurations for flexible perovskite devices are presented. In addition, the limitations and challenges for further application are also briefly discussed.

Abstract A ready-to use, highly sustainable solution for large scale exhausts catalytic abatement was developed: the active bricks. An environmentally-friendly composite was synthesized by depositing La_0.6Sr_0.4Ga_0.3Fe_0.7O_3, by combustion synthesis, on a fly ash-based geopolymer improved to bear the high temperatures (> 900 °C) required for synthesis. The geopolymer was obtained using by-products and was synthesized at RT: its production is sustainable and cost efficient. Prepared composites have been tested for methane oxidation and show good, durable activity above 400 °C. Thermal stability was also proved. Composites are a good solution for oxidation of fuel residues in industrial processes. Graphic Abstract 

90 :Perylene diimide based low band gap copolymers: synthesis, characterization and their applications in perovskite solar cells

10.1007/s10965-020-02212-3

In this study, newly designed perylene diimide based polymers P1 and P2 were synthesized and were used as hole transporting materials in place of the more common spiro-OMeTAD in perovskite solar cells. The co-polymers P1 - P2 were synthesized by Suzuki and direct arylation polymerizations of 2,9-bis(7-bromo-9,9-dioctyl-9 H -fluoren-2-yl)anthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10- d ’ e ’ f ’]diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2 H ,9 H )-tetrone M1 with 5,11-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-3,9-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-5,11-dihydoindolo[3,2-b]carbazole M2 and 3-octylthiophene M3 , respectively. P1 and P2 exhibit broad absorption spectra in thin film and solution with the absorption extending from the ultraviolet to visible and near infrared region of the solar spectrum. The water contact angles of P1 - P2 were determined to be 100.8° and 122.9°, respectively, showing good hydrophobicity for the synthesized copolymers. Both polymers show steady state photoluminescence quenching when blended with perovskite. Perovskite solar cell devices fabricated using P1-P2 in place of spiro-OMeTAD show power conversion efficiencies of 13.02% and 10.74%, respectively and manifest the potential of this class of materials as promising alternatives to conventionally used spiro-OMeTAD.

91 :Growth of centimeter-scale perovskite single-crystalline thin film via surface engineering

10.1186/s40580-020-00236-5

Modern electronic and photonic devices rely on single-crystalline thin film semiconductors for high performance and reproducibility. The emerging halide perovskites have extraordinary electronic and photonic properties and can be synthesized via low cost solution-based methods. They have been used in a variety of devices with performance approaching or over the devices based on conventional materials. However, their solution based growth method is intrinsically challenge to grow large scale single-crystalline thin film due to the random nucleation and isotropous growth of the crystal. Here, we report the growth of centimeter-scale perovskite single-crystalline thin films by controlling the nucleation density and growth rate of the crystal under a spatially confined growth condition. The hydrophobic treatment on substrates inhibits nucleation and accelerates the growth of single-crystalline thin film, providing enough space for initial nucleus growing up quickly without touching each other. Single-crystalline perovskite thin-film with an aspect ratio of 1000 (1 cm in side length, 10 μm in thickness) has been successfully grown. The low trap density and the high mobility of the as-grown thin film show a high crystallinity. The photodetector based on the perovskite thin film has achieved a gain ~ 10^4, benefitting from the short transit time of the carries due to the high mobility and thin thickness of the active layer. Our work opens up a new route to grow large scale perovskite single-crystalline thin films, providing a platform to develop high- performance devices.

92 :Synthesis, Microstructure, Dielectric and Ferroelectric Properties of (Na,Bi,K)TiO_3 Ceramics

10.1134/S1027451020040102

Single-phase ceramic samples with the perovskite structure [(Na_0.5Bi_0.5)_1 –  x K_ x ] TiO_3 ( x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06) are prepared by the method of solid-state synthesis and their structure, microstructure and dielectric and ferroelectric properties are studied. An increase in the unit-cell parameters of the perovskite lattice as a result of an increase in the K-cation content in accordance with the ratio of the radii of cations in the A sublattice of the perovskite structure is proved. The method of second-harmonic generation confirms that the introduction of potassium cations in the A positions of the perovskite lattice promotes enhancement of the ferroelectric properties of the studied samples. Dielectric-relaxation effects are revealed, which indicate the presence of vacancies in the oxygen sublattice.

93 :Synthesis and characterization of MnO_2 added (Na_0.475K_0.475Li_0.05)(Nb_0.9Ta_0.05Sb_0.05)O_3 lead-free piezoelectric ceramics

10.1007/s43207-020-00042-z

Lead-free NKLNTS ceramics with promising piezoelectric properties were fabricated using the solid phase method, which is a general ceramic manufacturing method. MnO_2 was added to NKLNTS ceramics as a sintering aid to improve piezoelectric and dielectric properties. The added MnO_2 content was adjusted to 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 wt%, the powder was calcined at 900 °C for 2 h, and then the sintering temperature was changed from 1000 to 1100 °C to study the optimum temperature and composition that yields excellent piezoelectric properties and sinterability. Archimedes method and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to evaluate the sinterability, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was performed to confirm the crystallinity of the sintered body, and piezoelectric and dielectric properties were evaluated using a d _33-meter and an impedance analyzer. When 0.1 wt% of MnO_2 was added, it was confirmed that density was the highest at the sintering temperature of 1050 °C and had excellent piezoelectric and dielectric properties. When 0.3 wt% or more of MnO_2 was added, piezoelectric and dielectric properties were decreased due to the decreased density. When NKLNTS-0.1wt% MnO_2 was sintered at a sintering temperature of 1050 ℃ for 2 h, it had a density of about 97%. Furthermore, lead-free piezoelectric ceramics with excellent piezoelectric and dielectric properties of d _33 = 271 pC/N, k _p = 0.40, ε _r = 1250, tan δ  = 2.5%, and T _c = 348 °C were fabricated.

94 :Structural and proton conductivity study of BaZr_1-xRE_xO_3-δ(RE = Dy, Sm) ceramics for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte

10.1007/s10008-019-04423-1

Proton-conducting BaZr_1- x RE_ x O_3- δ (RE = Dy, Sm) ( x  = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) ceramics were synthesized via a conventional mixed oxide reaction route. The X-ray diffraction patterns indicated that the studied compositions crystallized as a single phase in the cubic space group Pm 3 ¯ m $$ Pm\overline{3}m $$ . The site preference of the rare earth dopant has been proved by Rietveld analysis of the XRD profile, and the site occupancies have been derived for the studied compositions. Thermogravimetric study of the pre-hydrated samples showed a substantial mass loss, proving the oxygen vacancy filling by H_2O after hydration of the samples. Dense microstructures of sintered ceramics are observed, with the Dy-doped compositions showing fairly larger grains (2–3 μm) as compared to Sm-doped barium zirconate. The electrical conductivity under wet N_2 ( P H 2 O $$ {P}_{{\mathrm{H}}_2\mathrm{O}} $$  = 0.031 atm) environment has been calculated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The conductivity improved gradually with the increase in doping proportions, in case of both the dopants. However, the conductivity of Dy-doped BaZrO_3 is found one order higher as compared to Sm-doped BaZrO_3, for any fixed doping concentration. The total conductivity of 20% Dy-doped barium zirconate is found to be 4.15 × 10^−3 S/cm at 600 °C which is the highest among the studied compositions. The high proton conductivity suggests the material suitable for solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte at intermediate temperatures.

95 :Structural, electrical, and weak ferromagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic nature of Ni and La co-doped BaTiO_3 by sol–gel combustion route

10.1007/s10971-020-05311-1

We report on structural, electrical, and weak ferromagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic possessions of Ba_(1− x )La_ x Ni_0.01Ti_0.99O_3 (BLNT) samples with x  = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75%. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra show that the sol–gel combustion route synthesized samples are successfully incorporated with La^3+ ions into BaNi_0.01Ti_0.99O_3 (BNT) lattice. The EPR signals at g  = 1.967 and g  = 2.003 are attributed to the V_(Ba) and V_(Ti) defects, respectively. For x  = 0.75%, V_(Ba) signal disappears due to the subtle charge-compensation mechanism present in the BLNT sample. The BNT ceramics exhibit a weak ferromagnetic nature; upon La ion doping, the weak ferromagnetic (WFM) tends to exhibit strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) nature in BLNT. This magnetic phase transition can be described in the stipulation of the change in the oxidation state. Escalating in the dielectric constant and ac conductivity was due to the higher doping concentration of La^3+ ion in BNT ceramics. BLNT clearly shows that as La^3+ ion-doping concentration increases, the diameter of the impedance semicircle decreases due to the increased conducting nature of the samples. The ferroelectric property was deliberately investigated by a P–E hysteresis loop and its saturation polarization was found to decrease with increasing concentrations of La^3+ ion doping, and the observed results are discussed. Investigation on structural, electrical and magnetic properties of Ba_1- x La_ x Ni_0.01Ti_0.99O_3 (BLNT) for x  = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75% prepared through solgel combustion route. The EPR signals at g  = 1.967 and g  = 2.003 have been attributed to the V(Ba) and V(Ti) defects respectively. The increasing value of Ms and Hc with doping of La^3+ ion may be ascribed to exchange interactions between Ti^3+–Ti^4+ ions induced oxygen vacancies. The magnetic measurement revealed that weak WFM to AFM transition behavior devising from the transition metal ions and rare-earth doped multifunctional ceramics.

96 :Unraveling the roles of mesoporous TiO_2 framework in CH_3NH_3PbI_3 perovskite solar cells

Both of planar and mesoporous architectures prevail for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it is still an open question how the architecture affects the performance of PSCs. The inconsistent results in the references often create confusion. In particular, the specific roles of mesoporous frameworks are yet to be well elaborated and require further clarification. In this study, we carefully compared the properties of perovskite films and the device performances for both architectures to unravel the roles of mesoporous TiO_2 framworks in CH_3NH_3PbI_3 PSCs. The detailed characterizations of structural, microscopic, optical and electrical properties revealed that the presence of mesoporous TiO_2 framework contributed to enlarged perovskite crystal sizes, enhanced light harvesting, efficient electron extration and suppressed charge recombination. As a result, compared with the planar device, the mesoporous device yielded an improved power conversion efficiency of 18.18%, coupled with a reduced hystersis. This study reveals the benefits of mesoporous TiO_2 framework in PSCs and provides the guidance for the design and optimization of architectures for high-performance devices.

10.1007/s43207-020-00041-0

The syntheses, crystal structures, thermal decomposition, and optical absorbance spectra of the tantalum-based complex perovskite oxynitrides Ca_1/2Sr_1/2TaO_2N, Sr_1/2Ba_1/2TaO_2N, and Ca_1/3Sr_1/3Ba_1/3TaO_2N were investigated. Synchrotron X-ray Rietveld refinement showed that Ca_1/2Sr_1/2TaO_2N, Sr_1/2Ba_1/2TaO_2N, and Ca_1/3Sr_1/3Ba_1/3TaO_2N were tetragonal, cubic, and orthorhombic, respectively. Additionally, the lattice volume and Ta − O/N bond lengths varied in accordance with the mean ionic radius of the A-site cations. As determined using thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, the above complex perovskite oxynitrides underwent a two-step thermal decomposition consisting of O_2-uptake at 800–900 K with Δ H  = − 2620  to  − 2400 kJ/mol and the N_2 release at 1300–1450 K with Δ H  =  − 45 to   −66 kJ/mol. The optical band gaps were estimated from diffuse reflectance spectra as follows: Ca_1/2Sr_1/2TaO_2N (light orange), 2.35 eV; Ca_1/3Sr_1/3Ba_1/3TaO_2N (light brown), 2.0 eV; Sr_1/2Ba_1/2TaO_2N (red brown), 1.95 eV.

10.1007/s43207-020-00045-w

A direct utilization of hydrocarbon fuels in solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has been considered a worthwhile and realizable goal. Admittedly, while great strides have been made toward this development goal, there still remain Ni-based anode materials issues to be resolved. In this regard, this study focuses on Sr effect on electrical and electrochemical behaviors in PrBaMn_2O_5+ δ (PBM) to be employed as an anode in SOFC operation under hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels. The electrical conductivity of A-site layered PrBa_0.8Sr_0.2Mn_2O_5+ δ (PBSM) oxide reaches 3.74 S cm^−1 at 800 °C in H_2, which is higher than that of PBM due to doping smaller Sr into Ba site and fully meets the requirement to be employed as an anode material. The electrochemical performance is evaluated using La_0.9Sr_0.1Ga_0.8Mg_0.2O_3− δ electrolyte-supported cell based on A-site layered PBSM anode with Co–Fe catalysts, and shows peak power density around 1.38 and 0.68 W cm^−2 at 800 °C in H_2 and C_3H_8, respectively. Considering the electrical and electrochemical properties, A-site layered PBSM might offer the opportunities to discover and explore new high-performance anode material for direct hydrocarbon SOFCs.

99 :Cathode Performance Study of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ with Various Electrolyte-Doped Ceria Ce0.8Sm0.17Ln0.03O1.9 for IT-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell

10.1007/s11664-020-08167-x

La_0.6Sr_0.4Co_0.8Fe_0.2O_3-δ (LSCF) cathode perovskite prepared by a Pechini method deposited on ceria co-doping Ce_0.8Sm_0.17Ln_0.03O_1.9 (LnSDC), with (Ln = La, Y, and Nd) electrolytes was successfully prepared by the solid-state reaction method. In this preparation process, thick and thin films of LSCF were deposited upon dense Ln-doped ceria LnSDC electrolytes after 5 and 3 spin-coating and dip-coating cycles, respectively. Two layers of LSCF were deposited by screen-printing in order to obtain thick cathode films. After deposition, some structural and morphologic characterizations, such as X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy, have been conducted to understand the properties of the elaborated samples and to study the impact of doping on these properties. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements on symmetric cells were also performed to investigate the employability of L_0.6Sr_0.4Co_0.8Fe_0.2O_3-δ as a cathode material deposited upon LnSDC electrolytes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC). According to what was available and inferred after studying the images from a scanning electron microscope, no cracks or significant segregation were detected in the LSCF/LnSDC interface. This behavior is consistent with the good thermal expansion compatibility between the two materials. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy investigations at 700°C, indicate relatively low area-specific resistance between 0.048 and 0.1 Ω cm^2 for all symmetrical cell LSCF/doped electrolyte/LSCF. All the cells were previously sintered above 1400°C, in air. All these results showed that L_0.6Sr_0.4Co_0.8Fe_0.2O_3- δ can stand as a potential candidate for new cathode material in IT-SOFCs.

The design of new electrode materials with high redox stability has great potential for the fabrication of solid oxide fuel and electrolysis cells having a symmetrical configuration; such a configuration is particularly promising in terms of economic and technological factors due to involving a reduced number of functional materials and technological steps. Under the framework of the present study, we developed new Nd_1– x Ba_ x Fe_0.9 M _0.1O_3– δ materials (where M  = Cu or Ni, x  = 0.4 or 0.6), characterizing their functional properties (oxygen non-stoichiometry, thermomechanical and electrical properties) under both oxidizing and reducing conditions, as well as demonstrating the principal capability of their application as symmetrical electrodes in proton-conducting electrochemical cells. The obtained results demonstrate the desirability of a low barium content due to decreased thermal expansion coefficients and chemical strain contribution and Cu-doping due to the formation of an electrochemically active scaffold having nano-sized sediments. The Nd_0.6Ba_0.4Fe_0.9Cu_0.1O_3– δ electrodes fabricated onto the BaCe_0.5Zr_0.3Y_0.1Yb_0.1O_3– δ proton-conducting electrolytes exhibit polarization resistances of 1.1 and 15.1 Ω cm^2 at 600 °C in wet air and wet hydrogen measuring atmospheres, respectively. These reported results are among the first concerning the effective operation of symmetrical electrodes in systems with proton-conducting electrolytes. Graphical abstract
